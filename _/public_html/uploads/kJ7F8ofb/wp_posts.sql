That''s moving it <strong>down</strong> a class from B, which it is at now.\r\n\r\nCannabis, also known as Marijuana, skunk and more commonly known as weed, was reclassified and bumped up to Class B back in January of 2009, after it had been Class C since 2001, at the assertion of the then Home Secretary, David Blunket (a user, maybe? :p). Fortunately his views coincided with scientists at the time and it was then made Class C.\r\n\r\nI''m not too familiar with why it was bumped back up earlier this year, though it''s probably so they can lock more people up for longer ;) \r\n\r\nThe point of this blog thing is that I think it''s ridiculous that they now want to bump it back <strong>down</strong>, for the reason of "It''s as, or less harmful than Alcohol and Cigarettes". This then begs the question, in my mind, why is it not legalised? I mean, it''s a logical question, when you compare it to two legal drugs, and say it could be LESS harmful.. Or better yet, why are alcohol and cigarettes still legal? Up, Down, Up, Down, shake it all around.

So now, I can see the stuff I define in the acp on the page, which is great,  but you may notice "$error" hanging down there. That''s there because a] I haven''t changed any conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and b] because the $error variable needs defining in a whole new way now.\n\nSo I go through the mod again, changing the conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and &lt;else:if&gt; and now we''re ending up with a poorly styled, but at least it''s working mod.\n\nSo, now to style it. That above screenshot is using table tags, which vB4 apparently doesn''t like, or I was using the wrong class, or something, so I have to rewrite the table as a div, which is pretty easy to do, and now we have this;\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\n\nNow my mod is styled, and looking vaguely similar to the 3.8 version, it''s time to make the plugins for the who''s online status, and navtab.

I upgraded one of my (semi) popular vBulletin 3 hacks to vBulletin 4. I did <a href="http://twitter.com/madmikeyb">tweet</a> on my progress, but it was not an easy task. I feel like I''ve relearnt the alphabet, and I am still of the opinion that vBulletin 4 seems backwards.\r\n\r\nI am not currently using vBulletin 4 on any live site, so I did this all on my localhost setup, which is why I only have screenies, and no demo for you.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I took the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=224506">3.8 version</a> and imported it into vB4.

So now, I can see the stuff I define in the acp on the page, which is great,  but you may notice "$error" hanging down there.

Now, some will say that blogging about the experiment will tarnish the results, but that is a poor argument, as I get few readers on here, so the risk is SMALL.\n\nAside from that, I''ve been updating my <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/member.php?u=283564#hacks">vBulletin</a> Skins over to <a href="http://vbulletin.com/order">vBulletin 4</a>, as well as acquiring an interesting vBulletin domain name which I may put to use in future, and playing with the <a href="http://mods.mybboard.net/mods">MyBB Modding</a> and <a href="http://mods.mybboard.net/themes">Templating system</a>, so you may see some of those from me yet ;)\n\nThat''s all for now, Bloggity, I''ll keep you posted on the experiment and other such nonsense I do to keep myself occupied..', 'Dear Bloggity', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '185-revision', '', '', '2010-03-07 12:57:55', '2010-03-07 18:57:55', '', 185, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/185-revision-186', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I could''ve probably gone for a domain with a dash in it, like <a href="http://twitter.com/brandonsheley">Brandon Sheley</a> did with his general-forums.com domain, however I wasn''t prepared to put up with the hyphen, I like relatively short, and to the point domains, and that is what I think I got :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After about an hour of searching I started looking for obvious domains and they were also taken, so I googled my subject matter, tried some more, try, try, and try again is the moral of this story I think. Anyway I eventually got a semi decent one for my upcoming forum project :) It''s kinda abstract, but I like it, it kinda means a community, so hopefully it''s easy to remember. :p</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n', 'Choosing a domain is really hard!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '212-revision-4', '', '', '2010-04-28 00:54:39', '2010-04-28 06:54:39', '', 212, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/212-revision-4-231', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Yep, thats right, they all make things shiny, and increase the usability of the simple, boring, webpage. The question is, what is too much?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=jquery&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Google Search</a> for the popular buzzword of the day, jQuery, brings a TON of sites offering free ways to implement several new shiny features into your bland everyday website, however not many of these jQuery tricks are actually USEFUL to your members. Sure, they look nice, and are funky, but do they DO anything which isn''t already being done? The chances are, probably not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My delving into the world of what makes webpages shiny and ''cool'' was all started when I was trying to make <a href="http://onlyimages.info">a wallpapers site</a>, for personal use mainly, me and a few friends. As you can imagine, displaying 20 <em>2000x2000</em> HD wallpapers one after another is neither practical, nor efficient, and in truth, it is likely to crash the users browser, so I needed a way to resize them, and make them pop up, like lightbox does (it''s installed on this blog).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first plugin, and one which was quite promising was <a href="http://famspam.com/facebox">Facebox</a> - however it was not customisable enough, so I started looking for better options, more customisable, better browser compatibility, less code. I then thought about using <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> however this isn''t what I wanted to do. I wanted lightbox, I just didn''t know it, nor did I remember about it. Eventually I came upon this version of <a href="http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/">lightbox</a> - not sure if it''s the original one, but I like it nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon my travels in the jQuery world, I came across several interesting tidbits, such as <a href="http://www.codylindley.com/blogstuff/js/jtip/">jTip</a> - which I can use on <a href="http://onlyimages.info">OnlyImages</a> (the wallpaper site mentioned earlier) to put underneath the images, with a little tooltip, informing the user how to save the image.. Sure, I can use text to accomplish this, so it''s a little on my grey area of "need for usability vs want cos it looks nice" scale but still, it can improve the browsing experience of the user, I can add it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, upon the consistent nagging of <a href="http://twitter.com/chroder">Chroder</a> that CSS resizing the images on each page load simply isn''t good enough, I headed out in search of a jQuery plugin which would resize the images for me, as I really didn''t want to have to code a PHP thumbnailer! Well, guess what, turns out that jQuery has an answer to that, the aptly named "<a href="http://ditio.net/2010/01/02/jquery-image-resize-plugin/">jQuery Image Resize Plugin</a>"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the basic rules, or scale I followed was a <strong>need for usability</strong><em> vs </em><strong>want cos it looks nice</strong> - if it looked nice but didn''t add to usability, like this <a href="http://www.webintenta.com/9914.html">expanding and collapsing div</a> - while nice, I wouldn''t add it. I feel that this tactic works well and leads to an elegant site.</p>', 'Playing with Javascript; JQuery.

Yep, thats right, they all make things shiny, and increase the usability of the simple, boring, webpage. The question is, what is too much?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=jquery&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Google Search</a> for the popular buzzword of the day, jQuery, brings a TON of sites offering free ways to implement several new shiny features into your bland everyday website, however not many of these jQuery tricks are actually USEFUL to your members. Sure, they look nice, and are funky, but do they DO anything which isn''t already being done? The chances are, probably not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My delving into the world of what makes webpages shiny and ''cool'' was all started when I was trying to make <a href="http://onlyimages.info">a wallpapers site</a>, for personal use mainly, me and a few friends. As you can imagine, displaying 20 <em>2000x2000</em> HD wallpapers one after another is neither practical, nor efficient, and in truth, it is likely to crash the users browser, so I needed a way to resize them, and make them pop up, like lightbox does (it''s installed on this blog).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first plugin, and one which was quite promising was <a href="http://famspam.com/facebox">Facebox</a> - however it was not customisable enough, so I started looking for better options, more customisable, better browser compatibility, less code. I then thought about using <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> however this isn''t what I wanted to do. I wanted lightbox, I just didn''t know it, nor did I remember about it. Eventually I came upon this version of <a href="http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/">lightbox</a> - not sure if it''s the original one, but I like it nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon my travels in the jQuery world, I came across several interesting tidbits, such as <a href="http://www.codylindley.com/blogstuff/js/jtip/">jTip</a> - which I can use on <a href="http://onlyimages.info">OnlyImages</a> (the wallpaper site mentioned earlier) to put underneath the images, with a little tooltip, informing the user how to save the image.. Sure, I can use text to accomplish this, so it''s a little on my grey area of "need for usability vs want cos it looks nice" scale but still, it can improve the browsing experience of the user, I can add it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, upon the consistent nagging of <a href="http://twitter.com/chroder">Chroder</a> that CSS resizing the images on each page load simply isn''t good enough, I headed out in search of a jQuery plugin which would resize the images for me, as I really didn''t want to have to code a PHP thumbnailer! Well, guess what, turns out that jQuery has an answer to that, the aptly named "<a href="http://ditio.net/2010/01/02/jquery-image-resize-plugin/">jQuery Image Resize Plugin</a>"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the basic rules, or scale I followed was a <strong>need for usability</strong><em> vs </em><strong>want cos it looks nice</strong> - if it looked nice but didn''t add to usability, like this <a href="http://www.webintenta.com/9914.html">expanding and collapsing div</a> - while nice, I wouldn''t add it. I feel that this tactic works well and leads to an elegant site.</p>', 'Playing with Javascript; JQuery.

To test with, more than anything, however, I am now thinking of actually using the software on a live forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alot of the IPB admin control panel is confusing to me, as a devout <a id="lightbox">vBulletin user</a> alot of IPB is foreign to me, whereas I am very familiar with vB, having released several <a href="http://mikeydesigns.net/vbulletin-mods">mods</a> and providing professional <a href="http://mikeydesigns.net">vBulletin Services</a> and other such things for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, IPB from a user standpoint is quite friendly, some of the skins for it are very professionally done and don''t look simply like recolours, to licensed customers they even offer several services, such as the <a href="http://community.invisionpower.com/blog/1174/entry-4744-skin-generator-service/">Skin Generator</a> and the free IP.Links and IP.Shoutbox applications. The attitude toward customers is also very refreshing, with the guys at the top fighting over my support ticket, always nice to feel loved guys, lol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With <a href="http://community.invisionpower.com/topic/307302-welcome-to-ipboard-31/">all the new features</a> in the <a href="http://community.invisionpower.com/blog/1174/entry-4857-beta-releases-coming-soon/">upcoming IPB 3.1</a> release, IPB is looking more and more exciting by the day, the status updates feature has always been good, but they have improved even that in the new release, and the twitter connect functionality is pretty awesome also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> I haven''t yet looked into the Plugins side of IPB, you know, developing and such for it, but I have looked into the templating system, when I first saw it I thought, "oh god, not vB4 stylevars all over again" - but its really just a tabbed template system, each template opens in a new tab in the same window, if that makes any sense, which, again, is refreshing, in even vB3.8 - you have to go back through templates, save, open a new one, save, open, save. It gets very repetitive and boring, so that was a nice change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I am looking forward to more ''refreshing changes'' but I don''t think I will be ditching vBulletin any time soon, I may invest in IPB more though.

It gets very repetitive and boring, so that was a nice change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest, I am looking forward to more ''refreshing changes'' but I don''t think I will be ditching vBulletin any time soon, I may invest in IPB more though.

Yep, thats right, they all make things shiny, and increase the usability of the simple, boring, webpage. The question is, what is too much?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=jquery&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Google Search</a> for the popular buzzword of the day, jQuery, brings a TON of sites offering free ways to implement several new shiny features into your bland everyday website, however not many of these jQuery tricks are actually USEFUL to your members. Sure, they look nice, and are funky, but do they DO anything which isn''t already being done? The chances are, probably not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My delving into the world of what makes webpages shiny and ''cool'' was all started when I was trying to make <a href="http://onlyimages.info">a wallpapers site</a>, for personal use mainly, me and a few friends. As you can imagine, displaying 20 <em>2000x2000</em> HD wallpapers one after another is neither practical, nor efficient, and in truth, it is likely to crash the users browser, so I needed a way to resize them, and make them pop up, like lightbox does (it''s installed on this blog).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first plugin, and one which was quite promising was <a href="http://famspam.com/facebox">Facebox</a> - however it was not customisable enough, so I started looking for better options, more customisable, better browser compatibility, less code. I then thought about using <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/">jCarousel</a> however this isn''t what I wanted to do. I wanted lightbox, I just didn''t know it, nor did I remember about it. Eventually I came upon this version of <a href="http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/">lightbox</a> - not sure if it''s the original one, but I like it nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon my travels in the jQuery world, I came across several interesting tidbits, such as <a href="http://www.codylindley.com/blogstuff/js/jtip/">jTip</a> - which I can use on <a href="http://onlyimages.info">OnlyImages</a> (the wallpaper site mentioned earlier) to put underneath the images, with a little tooltip, informing the user how to save the image.. Sure, I can use text to accomplish this, so it''s a little on my grey area of "need for usability vs want cos it looks nice" scale but still, it can improve the browsing experience of the user, I can add it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, upon the consistent nagging of <a href="http://twitter.com/chroder">Chroder</a> that CSS resizing the images on each page load simply isn''t good enough, I headed out in search of a jQuery plugin which would resize the images for me, as I really didn''t want to have to code a PHP thumbnailer! Well, guess what, turns out that jQuery has an answer to that, the aptly named "<a href="http://ditio.net/2010/01/02/jquery-image-resize-plugin/">jQuery Image Resize Plugin</a>"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the basic rules, or scale I followed was a <strong>need for usability</strong><em> vs </em><strong>want cos it looks nice</strong> - if it looked nice but didn''t add to usability, like this <a href="http://www.webintenta.com/9914.html">expanding and collapsing div</a> - while nice, I wouldn''t add it.

I upgraded one of my (semi) popular vBulletin 3 hacks to vBulletin 4. I did <a href="http://twitter.com/madmikeyb">tweet</a> on my progress, but it was not an easy task. I feel like I''ve relearnt the alphabet, and I am still of the opinion that vBulletin 4 seems backwards.\r\n\r\nI am not currently using vBulletin 4 on any live site, so I did this all on my localhost setup, which is why I only have screenies, and no demo for you.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I took the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=224506">3.8 version</a> and imported it into vB4.

So now, I can see the stuff I define in the acp on the page, which is great,  but you may notice "$error" hanging down there. That''s there because a] I haven''t changed any conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and b] because the $error variable needs defining in a whole new way now.\r\n\r\nSo I go through the mod again, changing the conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and &lt;else:if&gt; and now we''re ending up with a poorly styled, but at least it''s working mod.\r\n\r\nSo, now to style it. That above screenshot is using table tags, which vB4 apparently doesn''t like, or I was using the wrong class, or something, so I have to rewrite the table as a div, which is pretty easy to do, and now we have this;\r\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow my mod is styled, and looking vaguely similar to the 3.8 version, it''s time to make the plugins for the who''s online status, and navtab.

Twitter is NOT Facebook, and hey, I know you''re the ones with the business model, but I personally don''t think that you should aspire to be.\r\n\r\nFirst you add retweet integration, which is awesome, build on something invented by the community, loving it, it''s this type of attitude which makes twitter so great, as it seems that you actually listen to your users..\r\n\r\nThen you add lists, which is cool for some, we can add friends to certain lists, follow entire lists, okay, this is kinda cool, though it''s a use it then forget it feature, I know that I, a daily visitor to your site, certainly haven''t used lists more than once, and so don''t see the repeat appeal.\r\n\r\nNow I see you''re adding a "local trends" feature, yet you''re obviously aiming it towards the US, as I only see three european countries on this list. If I wanted to get the local trends, I''d do a search on twitter or google, or go outside and read a newspaper, to paraphrase someone on <a href="http://mikeylicio.us/irc/">IRC</a> "I wouldn''t be on the net if I cared what was going on around me".\r\n\r\nWhy have I written this?

(292, 1, '2010-06-03 17:22:13', '2010-06-03 23:22:13', 'Today I undertook a task. A task of some magnitude, as I haven''t done it ever before. I upgraded one of my (semi) popular vBulletin 3 hacks to vBulletin 4. I did <a href="http://twitter.com/madmikeyb">tweet</a> on my progress, but it was not an easy task. I feel like I''ve relearnt the alphabet, and I am still of the opinion that vBulletin 4 seems backwards.\r\n\r\nI am not currently using vBulletin 4 on any live site, so I did this all on my localhost setup, which is why I only have screenies, and no demo for you.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I took the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=224506">3.8 version</a> and imported it into vB4. This gave me internal server errors, so I headed over to the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=242">vB4 articles section</a> on <a href="http://vbulletin.org">vBulletin.org</a> and looked through some articles.\r\n\r\nAfter I''d figured out the internal server error problem, (My radio.php wasn''t in the new format) I ended up with this (click images to get full view):\r\n\r\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-baby-steps.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-baby-steps.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nSo, I investigated futher, and found out that the $vboptions[param] was deprecated, and instead I had to use {vb:raw vboptions.param}, so I labouriously went through my templates, and changed them one by one, which <a href="http://twitter.com/MadMikeyB/statuses/8378971826">I wasn''t that happy about</a> - Anyway, after that, we''re looking at this:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4--finally-some-progress.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4--finally-some-progress.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\n...Finally, some progress, right? So now, I can see the stuff I define in the acp on the page, which is great,  but you may notice "$error" hanging down there. That''s there because a] I haven''t changed any conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and b] because the $error variable needs defining in a whole new way now.\r\n\r\nSo I go through the mod again, changing the conditionals to &lt;vb:if&gt; and &lt;else:if&gt; and now we''re ending up with a poorly styled, but at least it''s working mod.\r\n\r\nSo, now to style it. That above screenshot is using table tags, which vB4 apparently doesn''t like, or I was using the wrong class, or something, so I have to rewrite the table as a div, which is pretty easy to do, and now we have this;\r\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-mod-styled-yay.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow my mod is styled, and looking vaguely similar to the 3.8 version, it''s time to make the plugins for the who''s online status, and navtab. I headed back to the vB4 Articles Section on vBulletin.org and found an article posted by <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/member.php?find=lastposter&amp;t=226914">Lynne</a>, I adapted the code she posted, and hey presto, a working navtab, and who''s online locations!\r\n\r\nEt voila! Finished product;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-lastfm-complete.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/vb4-lastfm-complete.png" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou can download that here; <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=234495">http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=234495</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall the experience was LONG. It took way too long to upgrade such a simple mod, and I feel sorry for those who have massive mods to upgrade, heh.\r\n\r\n', 'vB3 > vB4 Mod Upgrade Experience', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '150-revision-10', '', '', '2010-06-03 17:22:13', '2010-06-03 23:22:13', '', 150, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/150-revision-10-292', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Personally, if I had an iPod, and I installed an Application, such as Facebook, (example) and Apple served me ads, every 5 page refreshes, it''d get pretty annoying. Then of course, Facebook has inline ads also. It gets real messy real quick. Opinion: Dislike<br />\r\n<h2>Microsofts Bing comes to iPhone</h2>\r\nWell, this is something I didn''t think I would see, Microsoft and Apple working together. Google will, of course, remain the favorite and the default SE for Apple devices, but it''s been said that Microsoft have been working hard to move Bing over to HTML5 so that it''s ''Apple Approved'' for the iPhone, so good on them I say. Opinion: Like<br />\r\n<h2>iMovie</h2>\r\nIf I''m honest, this may flop, but it''s a nice idea, Usually you shoot a video and edit it on your iMac or Mac Pro (I dont have either, so I''d have to buy one) so the idea of being able to edit it right there on your iPhone is a nice one. It''s also a nice price at only $4.99. Opinion: Could work<br />\r\n<h2>iBooks</h2>\r\nI do like this one, you download a Book, as a PDF, and it goes on your iBookshelf which is accessible via iPad, iPod and iPhone. This is the feature I like the best, the ability to data sync ability, maybe they could apply it to iPhone (maybe it''s already possible), so when you buy a new iPhone you can just sync your phone numbers across. It has many possibilities :) Opinion: Like.\r\n<h3>Summary</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nSounds like Apple are bringing alot more features to the table and alot of these are innovative as we have come to expect from Apple. :D', 'Apple WWDC', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'apple-wwdc', '', '', '2010-08-03 11:15:42', '2010-08-03 17:15:42', '', 0, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/apple-wwdc-300', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I think it''s safe to assume that all of these members are from vBulletin or IPB forums, and have an interest in running the product. The product has currently received a very very positive reception from these formerly disgruntled customers of vBulletin/IPB, which is good in itself, however I feel that it is missing some core features, and I''m personally keeping a list of all the things I''m seeing, and thinking <em>"ooh, that''d be nice if we can do something like this with x, and something which works with y and z"</em>.\r\n\r\nWhat also is making me cringe, is people are willing to jump into the product and fully support it without so much as a hint at the backend options, the plugin system, the templating system, etc. I see people on the official xenForo Community Forum with sigs like "xen<popularvbmodname> coming soon.."\r\n\r\nHere''s what I''ve been posting on the plethora of forums which are currently hosting topics filled with people drooling after the software, people are claiming that it will be the vB/IPB killer, I guess only time will tell.\r\n<blockquote>Don''t count on every vB owner dropping their licenses and moving to xenForo. What most likely will happen is they will keep their exisiting boards on vB, and any new startups will be powered by xenForo.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI know that this blog post is seeming very negative, but I wanted it to seem that way, because I think it is important for others to see it from a different perspective, and not through the rose tinted glasses they''re all wearing. In truth, <a href="">I like xenForo</a>, I''ve known about it since I found the Facebook group on June 20th, I saw it, informed a few select friends and then we all kept schtum and waited. Upon seeing this build, even at Alpha stages, I think that it will shape up to be a very fine product, but it''ll take a while to beat vB or IPB, (no matter what the hyped up masses are saying on the company forums), though I think that in its current form it is beating free alternatives such as <a href="http://phpbb.com">PHPBB</a> and <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/">SMF</a> hands down.

This post aims to be a guide for you Windows users on how to use dropbox successfully.\r\n\r\nRight, let''s get started, we''re assuming that you have not got a dropbox account yet. Step by step instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sign up - want 250MB extra space from the get go? Course you do! use my <a rel="lightbox" href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTEyOTY3MDA5">Referral</a> link then :)</li>\r\n	<li><a rel="lightbox" href="https://www.dropbox.com/downloading">Download</a> and install dropbox.</li>\r\n	<li>Navigate to wherever you install Dropbox (for example, ''(My) Documents'' and you''ll see ''<a rel="lightbox" href="http://mikey.junkput.com/2010-08-03-19h32_44.png">My Dropbox</a>''</li>\r\n	<li>Inside ''My Dropbox'' are (by default) two directories, Photos, and Public - and a txt file (<a rel="lightbox" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1296700/This%20is%20your%20Dropbox.txt">this one ;)</a>) - it''s the ''Public'' file we''re interested in, as all files you drop in there go into your web accessible folder.</li>\r\n	<li>Now, get familiar with Dropbox, get any image, drag and drop it into your ''public'' folder. Now, wait till it has a little green tick beside it, this means it''s synced with the dropbox cloud, you can then right click the image, and get the dropbox link. <a rel="lightbox" href="http://mikey.junkput.com/2010-08-03-19h43_55.png">Like so.</a></li>\r\n	<li>Right, so we have dropbox installed, we know where our files go. Now we need an easy, quick way to send files there with the push of a key. Mac and Ubuntu have in-built apps where you hit prntscrn on the keyboard and it asks you where to save it. We don''t get this with windows, but never fear!</li>\r\n	<li>Yes, the windows alternative to this software is called ''<a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.screenpresso.com/">Screenpresso</a>'' - Download it, install it, try it out by hitting the print screen button. First time, navigate to your dropbox public folder and save an image, it''ll save there without any problems from then on in.</li>\r\n	<li>You now have a file which has a name of something like 2010-08-03-19h43_55.png - there are two things you can do, a] work out how to CNAME a domain to dropbox, so you can have db.mysite.com/2010-08-03-19h43_55.png (like I have with <em>mikey.junkput.com</em> - generously figured out by <a rel="lightbox" href="http://chrisnadeau.com">Chris</a>) or b] just create a shortcut to your dropbox folder and find the file, and right click it (or even remember your dropbox userid and type the url manually)</li>\r\n	<li>These are the absolute basics you need to know to work with dropbox.

Now we need an easy, quick way to send files there with the push of a key. Mac and Ubuntu have in-built apps where you hit prntscrn on the keyboard and it asks you where to save it. We don''t get this with windows, but never fear!</li>\n	<li>Yes, the windows alternative to this software is called ''<a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.screenpresso.com/">Screenpresso</a>'' - Download it, install it, try it out by hitting the print screen button. First time, navigate to your dropbox public folder and save an image, it''ll save there without any problems from then on in.</li>\n	<li>You now have a file which has a name of something like 2010-08-03-19h43_55.png - there are two things you can do, a] work out how to CNAME a domain to dropbox, so you can have db.mysite.com/2010-08-03-19h43_55.png (like I have with <em>mikey.junkput.com</em> - generously figured out by <a rel="lightbox" href="http://chrisnadeau.com">Chris</a>) or b] just create a shortcut to your dropbox folder and find the file, and right click it (or even remember your dropbox userid and type the url manually)</li>\n	<li>These are the absolute basics you need to know to work with dropbox. HTML files will be parsed and output, so will css files, you can host small html files on your dropbox, but PHP doesnt get parsed, you can''t use things such as .htacce\n\n </li></ul>', 'Dropbox - Guide [Windows]', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '345-revision-2', '', '', '2010-08-03 12:48:20', '2010-08-03 18:48:20', '', 345, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/345-revision-2-396', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I only actively admin one vBulletin site and the IP.Board site is <a href="http://thegeekdistrict.com">The Geek District</a> which is one which I enjoy running.<br /><br />Due to my dwindling list of Forums, it makes me wonder what it is which is causing the lack of usage nowadays - I have also noticed that it''s not just me who has problems committing to a forum and posting there daily, I''ve noticed an increase in the amount of people using Twitter to communicate with me (based on my follower count and the seemingly unknown people who tweet at me) and a steady decrease in people using Facebook. (this may be due to my Facebook privacy settings.)<br />Could it be that Twitter is killing the forum goers? I''ve also noticed a decline in new non-automated postings on the blogs I visit (btw, check out the awesome ''friend blogs'' in my sidebar), maybe Twitter is to blame here too? People are used to expressing themselves now in 140 characters or less, and I posit that people have become lazy in their internet postings.<br /><br />While some may seem happy *cough*<a href="http://twitter.com/Mikouen">@Mikouen</a>*cough* to see this blog post, it makes me wonder what the future has in store for me, what will keep me interested in forums, and if I''ll start another. It''ll probably be some interesting development in one of the Forum Softwares which rekindles my interest, but until then, I''m joining less and less sites, and dropping activity on the others.<br /><br /><br />Of course, it <em>could</em> just be the increase in my <a href="http://mikeydesigns.net/vbulletin-services">vBulletin Services</a> work which is leaving me with less and less time for forums, only time will tell I suppose, and I bet I''ll always have a place in my life for forums :)', 'Future of Forums?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '361-revision-4', '', '', '2010-07-24 09:18:44', '2010-07-24 15:18:44', '', 361, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/361-revision-4-366', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It''s also a nice price at only $4.99. Opinion: Could work<br />\r\n<h2>iBooks</h2>\r\nI do like this one, you download a Book, as a PDF, and it goes on your iBookshelf which is accessible via iPad, iPod and iPhone.

Now, wait till it has a little green tick beside it, this means it''s synced with the dropbox cloud, you can then right click the image, and get the dropbox link. <a rel="lightbox" href="http://mikey.junkput.com/2010-08-03-19h43_55.png">Like so.</a></li>\r\n	<li>Right, so we have dropbox installed, we know where our files go.

HTML files will be parsed and output, so will css files, you can host small html files on your dropbox, but PHP doesnt get parsed, you can''t use things such as .htaccess, nor would you be able to host something like a forum from your dropbox account..</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWell, now you''re on your way to using dropbox daily like I do :) Good luck, enjoy!\r\n\r\n ', 'Dropbox - Guide [Windows]', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '345-revision-5', '', '', '2010-08-03 12:54:19', '2010-08-03 18:54:19', '', 345, 'http://mikeylicio.us/random/345-revision-5-400', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

If you''re not interested in coding, php or frameworks I suggest you close the tab now.</em></span>\r\n\r\nSo.. I''ve been researching PHP frameworks and such, as everyone says I should use one and that they would never dream of coding a whole web-application with bare-bones procedural PHP.. I looked into <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony</a> - too complex, I looked into <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend</a>, and didn''t really like it, and finally settled on <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIt''s light hearted attitude to itself and programming with it is exactly what I need, and that''s exactly what I enjoy most about Cake. After reading the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">Cake Cookbook</a> I really feel I know most of what Cake has to offer, and I had a fully fledged registration and login system done within an hour, it was great. \r\n\r\nI''m using Cake to develop a new site idea of mine, which I''ll probably blog about later, however one of the few things which I find to be a love/hate thing with Cake is the rigidness. You can''t possibly have a table for users that isn''t named users! The way the framework forces you to use certain naming conventions, and disallows certain names annoys me, but it''s also the thing which makes it easiest to debug.. Most of it can be battled by overrides in the controllers though, so it''s not that big a deal once you''re no longer a newbie (like I am). So like I said, love/hate thing.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is my first foray into Object Oriented Programming, and Cake eased me into the MVC (<a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/890/Understanding-Model-View-Controller">Model View Controller</a>), which some apps that I use and want to code for also use (read: <a href="http://mikeylicio.us/random/xenforo-374">XenForo</a>), quite nicely, I kinda understand the basics behind the MVC now, but I''m still having to stop myself from using Procedural PHP every now and again.', 'Coding with Cake', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'i-heart-cakephp', '', '\nhttp://mikeylicio.us/random/xenforo-374', '2011-02-15 18:12:46', '2011-02-16 00:12:46', '', 0, 'http://mikeylicio.us/?p=693', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(730, 1, '2011-04-02 10:57:06', '2011-04-02 16:57:06', 'Just really something I''ve been noticing as I read tutorials for my new application I''m developing, the 10 (ish) things I see most (PHP) coders doing, which they shouldn''t in Web Dev/Design.\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Flash is Evil</a>, designed as a competitor to the web, not to be used on it. <a href="http://www.html5video.org/">Try HTML5 for Video.</a></p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Don''t rely on external libraries to load your page, such as javascript/jquery, prototype, flash/actionscript, mootools, or any other libraries. If a user has Javascript disabled, your web page should still display fine.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. In addition to the above, if you do use javascript extensively to display content (you really shouldn''t), please for the love of any omnipotent being, don''t use a Hashbang in your url''s. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hashbangs+evil">It''s horrible.</a></p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Don''t use &lt;table&gt; or &lt;font&gt; tags. They''re deprecated for a reason, in 1999 it was fine to use tables to lay out your content, but since the advent of CSS, it''s often easier now to use divs and classes, or even HTML5 Elements combined with CSS. (<a href="http://switchtohtml5.com">Switch To HTML5</a>) The same can be said for adding styling to your text.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Don''t use &lt;style&gt;. It''s horrible practise. For a development site just to see how it looks and to tweak, it''s perfect, but in a production site it''s not really an option unless all other options are unavailable.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Don''t make your navigation cluttered. This one is more web design rather than web development. People need to be able to navigate your site without needing a phD in computing. If an 8 year old can find the "log in" link after less than a minute, you''re good.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. Add a search feature. If someone can''t find something on your site, and there is no "Search" box, you''ve just lost a visitor. If all of your visitors are potential customers, then you just lost money. If you don''t know how to code, it''s easy, <a href="http://google.com/cse">Google offers a free embeddable search engine for your website with CSE.</a></p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8. Don''t rely on images to display your most important content. I see web hosting companies doing this mostly, some text, then their price as an image. Your price is the most important part of the page, and if you display it as an image, someone with a slow connection will possibly not see it.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9. Don''t make a crap web design, simple as that. Don''t use excessive bright colours, Don''t use a million and one different fonts, <strong>no comic sans for the love of god</strong>, try to keep it uniform throughout. People like consistency.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10. Don''t spam it up with ads! If you have a sidebar, use it for content, not advertisements.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">11a. PHP: Don''t use shorthand. It''s the same as styling using the &lt;style&gt; tag. &lt;?= ?&gt; tags only save a tiny bit of typing, so don''t be lazy, do it right.</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">11b. PHP OOP: Don''t edit the core controller!! If all of your controllers extend "Controller", please don''t edit "Controller".. Any errors you make in that file are passed to all the Controllers extending that class, and it makes debugging a pain.

If you register on the site you can read that here: <a href="http://30daychallenges.net/challenges/info/2">http://30daychallenges.net/challenges/info/2</a>. It''s a nice story to tell, but a lot of long nights coding were involved, and a lot of poking from my friends, so once more, thanks to them :)\r\n\r\nI''ve set myself another challenge to continue, you can view my progress on that one here: <a href="http://30daychallenges.net/challenges/info/51">http://30daychallenges.net/challenges/info/51</a>\r\n\r\nYou should probably read this blog entry on the site itself: <a href="http://30daychallenges.net/blogs/entry/welcome-to-30-day-challenges/1"><strong>Welcome to 30 Day Challenges</strong></a>, feel free to comment over there!\r\n\r\nI started following people with the <a href="http://twitter.com/30dme">twitter account</a> a few hours ago so you may have noticed already.

If a user has Javascript disabled, your web page should still display fine.</li>\r\n	<li>In addition to the above, if you do use javascript extensively to display content (you really shouldn''t), please for the love of any omnipotent being, don''t use a Hashbang in your url''s. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=hashbangs+evil">It''s horrible.</a></li>\r\n	<li>Don''t use &lt;table&gt; or &lt;font&gt; tags. They''re deprecated for a reason, in 1999 it was fine to use tables to lay out your content, but since the advent of CSS, it''s often easier now to use divs and classes, or even HTML5 Elements combined with CSS. (<a href="http://switchtohtml5.com">Switch To HTML5</a>) The same can be said for adding styling to your text.</li>\r\n	<li>Don''t use &lt;style&gt;. It''s horrible practise. For a development site just to see how it looks and to tweak, it''s perfect, but in a production site it''s not really an option unless all other options are unavailable.</li>\r\n	<li>Don''t make your navigation cluttered. This one is more web design rather than web development. People need to be able to navigate your site without needing a phD in computing. If an 8 year old can find the "log in" link after less than a minute, you''re good. </li>\r\n	<li>Add a search feature. If someone can''t find something on your site, and there is no "Search" box, you''ve just lost a visitor. If all of your visitors are potential customers, then you just lost money. If you don''t know how to code, it''s easy, <a href="http://google.com/cse">Google offers a free embeddable search engine for your website with CSE.</a></li>\r\n	<li>Don''t rely on images to display your most important content. I see web hosting companies doing this mostly, some text, then their price as an image. Your price is the most important part of the page, and if you display it as an image, someone with a slow connection will possibly not see it.</li>\r\n	<li>Don''t make a crap web design, simple as that. Don''t use excessive bright colours, Don''t use a million and one different fonts, try to keep it uniform throughout. People like consistency.</li>\r\n	<li>Don''t spam it up with ads! If you have a sidebar, use it for content, not advertisements.</li>\r\n\r\n	<li>PHP: Don''t use shorthand. It''s the same as styling using the &lt;style&gt; tag.  &lt;?= ?&gt; tags only save a tiny bit of typing, so don''t be lazy, do it right.</li>\r\n	<li>PHP OOP: Don''t edit the core controller!! If all of your controllers extend "Controller", please don''t edit "Controller".. Any errors you make in that file are passed to all the Controllers extending that class, and it makes debugging a pain. Please don''t tell users to edit the core "Controller" class if you''re writing a tutorial, it''s horrendously irresponsible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, just think it out before you do it, consider the implications of putting that there, and if you don''t know what you''re doing, I suggest you learn before trying to put a website/Web Design together.
