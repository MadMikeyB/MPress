We hadn''t heard of it, but the grievances expressed by the reporter sound a lot like the grievances expressed by members of Occupy Tampa the last few months: that the site looks bad, and that nobody can see anyone doing much.\r\n\r\nWe need help. Rather than ask for your help, we''d like to turn the tables and ask you how WE can help YOU turn the camp site into the park that you would like to see it become. We want to blur the line that divides "us" from "the community," because we believe that communities should control their commons. We are all the 99 percent. Lets please work together to craft a "good neighbor policy."\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the park come alive as a common space for everyone: to work on projects, to enjoy each others'' company, and live. To help us design the good neighbor policy, and to begin collaborating on projects, please show up for the General Assembly. We hold it on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 7:30 PM. You can also email community@occupytampa.org with your project ideas, grievances, questions, or anything else.\r\n\r\nAlso, on July 7th, please join us for a barbecue and celebration. Let''s try to imagine what a commons for West Tampa could look like, and share ideas about the future of Voice of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOccupy Tampa\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>', 'Open Forum Barbeque', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2191-revision-3', '', '', '2012-07-04 16:31:38', '2012-07-04 20:31:38', '', 2191, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/07/04/2191-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I have a hypothesis as to why this has happened, based on my own experiences wondering whether or not to go to GA:\r\n\r\nI attended several disappointingly small assemblies, including ones that had zero announcements and proposals.\r\n\r\nI attend General Assemblies hoping for stimulation: interesting announcements and proposals, interesting conversations, a chance to see my friends and make new ones, and a chance to find projects to participate in. If I doubt many people will show up, I doubt these things will happen.\r\n\r\nBy instilling confidence in a central time for GA, people will assume a better turnout and therefore attend. Attendance will slowly increase for the first few and will then spiral into much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nIn Toledo, a proposal came up to reduce GA frequency to Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. I worried that it would kill the vitality of our movement. But the results proved me wrong, GA attendance exploded.\r\n\r\nPeople then had energy to direct their attention to participating in the working groups. This represents the second stage of an Occupy. They usually start with large, disorganized assemblies and then organize into working groups. The General Assembly then becomes more of a reporting ground for the working groups to update each other, to announce new groups, and to pass grand proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, by losing the ability to have a meeting every day, we loose the ability to address daily problems, we loose the ability to remind each other what projects need help, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore the kernel of my proposal at this time goes like this:\r\n\r\nAFTER ESTABLISHING THE DAYS THAT WORK BEST FOR PEOPLE, WE WILL CHOOSE TWO DAYS OF THE WEEK (during this proposal''s stack, hopefully) AND CALL THEM "GENERAL ASSEMBLY." ON THE OTHER DAYS, WE WILL HOLD "DAILY ASSEMBLY."\r\n\r\nIf, for example, you have a proposal that, in the spirit of true consensus, should solicit the input of the greater movement, you''ll want to announce it at a General Assembly. If your proposal only concerns people at camp, or will likely affect a small range of stakeholders, and seems generally agreeable, it will matter less which day you propose it. Since the occupation represents an ever-changing entity, all proposals remain tentative anyway, if the General Assembly has input they can address that when they meet.\r\n\r\nSo, if some people absolutely can never make it on the days chosen for the General Assembly, that won''t mean exclusion from the "club." They can direct their energy into the working groups they care about, and, confident in our commitment to work together, use the working group, or a friend, or the internet, or any medium they like as their lisasion to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the future I''d like to see an even more organized assembly where we solicit announcements and proposals online, between GA''s, to stimulate much of the conversation in advance and help a wider range of people participate.\r\n\r\nLarger GA''s mean more people to help facilitate. We can finally divide facilitation responsibilities among roles like "vibes checker," and "internet stack taker," and "whiteboard squiggler," etc ...\r\n\r\nI announced this well in advance, so that I can schedule the discussion and hopeful passing of the proposal during an assembly most people can attend. We will take internet stack too, in an effort to give all stakeholder a voice. I will likely propose it at the Regional Assembly, since the decision, in a sense, affects everyone in the greater area, because they might want to attend our GA''s too. Also it will provide a good environment to improve our skills working with an important proposal.\r\n\r\nhttp://occupytampa.titanpad.com/18', 'An Important Proposal for this Saturday''s Regional General Assembly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-3', '', '', '2012-05-28 13:43:09', '2012-05-28 18:43:09', '', 23, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/05/28/23-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I have a hypothesis as to why this has happened, based on my own experiences wondering whether or not to go to GA:\r\n\r\nI attended several disappointingly small assemblies, including ones that had zero announcements and proposals.\r\n\r\nI attend General Assemblies hoping for stimulation: interesting announcements and proposals, interesting conversations, a chance to see my friends and make new ones, and a chance to find projects to participate in. If I doubt many people will show up, I doubt these things will happen.\r\n\r\nBy instilling confidence in a central time for GA, people will assume a better turnout and therefore attend. Attendance will slowly increase for the first few and will then spiral into much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nIn Toledo, a proposal came up to reduce GA frequency to Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. I worried that it would kill the vitality of our movement. But the results proved me wrong, GA attendance exploded.\r\n\r\nPeople then had energy to direct their attention to participating in the working groups. This represents the second stage of an Occupy. They usually start with large, disorganized assemblies and then organize into working groups. The General Assembly then becomes more of a reporting ground for the working groups to update each other, to announce new groups, and to pass grand proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, by losing the ability to have a meeting every day, we loose the ability to address daily problems, we loose the ability to remind each other what projects need help, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore the kernel of my proposal at this time goes like this:\r\n\r\nAFTER ESTABLISHING THE DAYS THAT WORK BEST FOR PEOPLE, WE WILL CHOOSE TWO DAYS OF THE WEEK (during this proposal''s stack, hopefully) AND CALL THEM "GENERAL ASSEMBLY." ON THE OTHER DAYS, WE WILL HOLD "DAILY ASSEMBLY."\r\n\r\nIf, for example, you have a proposal that, in the spirit of true consensus, should solicit the input of the greater movement, you''ll want to announce it at a General Assembly. If your proposal only concerns people at camp, or will likely affect a small range of stakeholders, and seems generally agreeable, it will matter less which day you propose it. Since the occupation represents an ever-changing entity, all proposals remain tentative anyway, if the General Assembly has input they can address that when they meet.\r\n\r\nSo, if some people absolutely can never make it on the days chosen for the General Assembly, that won''t mean exclusion from the "club." They can direct their energy into the working groups they care about, and, confident in our commitment to work together, use the working group, or a friend, or the internet, or any medium they like as their lisasion to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the future I''d like to see an even more organized assembly where we solicit announcements and proposals online, between GA''s, to stimulate much of the conversation in advance and help a wider range of people participate.\r\n\r\nLarger GA''s mean more people to help facilitate. We can finally divide facilitation responsibilities among roles like "vibes checker," and "internet stack taker," and "whiteboard squiggler," etc ...\r\n\r\nI announced this well in advance, so that I can schedule the discussion and hopeful passing of the proposal during an assembly most people can attend. We will take internet stack too, in an effort to give all stakeholder a voice. I will likely propose it at the Regional Assembly, since the decision, in a sense, affects everyone in the greater area, because they might want to attend our GA''s too. Also it will provide a good environment to improve our skills working with an important proposal.\r\n\r\nhttp://occupytampa.titanpad.com/18', 'An Important Proposal for this Saturday''s General Assembly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-4', '', '', '2012-05-28 18:05:50', '2012-05-28 23:05:50', '', 23, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/05/28/23-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

What steps can we take to demonstrate real solidarity and communicate with each other?

The Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly will not operate from one location, rather, we ask that each occupation try to locate, and occupy, a space to allow our collective Assembly. We will rotate the responsibilities of hosting the Regional Assembly between the participating occupations.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa proposes to host the first Regional General Assembly on Saturday, June 2nd 2012 at our birth place: Gaslight Park, 410 N. Franklin St., Tampa, FL.\r\n\r\nThe Regional General Assembly will likely form the agenda for the first gathering on this date. We would like to propose that participants arrive at 11AM to prepare for the Assembly, which will start at 12.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of consensus, we ask that you please present the Regional General Assembly as a proposal to your city’s Occupation. We look forward to joining with you, and defending freedom from the government and corporations who want to take it away!\r\n\r\nYou have been urged to assert your power.

I have a hypothesis as to why this has happened, based on my own experiences wondering whether or not to go to GA:\r\n\r\nI attended several disappointingly small assemblies, including ones that had zero announcements and proposals.\r\n\r\nI attend General Assemblies hoping for stimulation: interesting announcements and proposals, interesting conversations, a chance to see my friends and make new ones, and a chance to find projects to participate in. If I doubt many people will show up, I doubt these things will happen.\r\n\r\nBy instilling confidence in a central time for GA, people will assume a better turnout and therefore attend. Attendance will slowly increase for the first few and will then spiral into much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nIn Toledo, a proposal came up to reduce GA frequency to Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. I worried that it would kill the vitality of our movement. But the results proved me wrong, GA attendance exploded.\r\n\r\nPeople then had energy to direct their attention to participating in the working groups. This represents the second stage of an Occupy. They usually start with large, disorganized assemblies and then organize into working groups. The General Assembly then becomes more of a reporting ground for the working groups to update each other, to announce new groups, and to pass grand proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, by losing the ability to have a meeting every day, we loose the ability to address daily problems, we loose the ability to remind each other what projects need help, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore the kernel of my proposal at this time goes like this:</blockquote>\r\n<h5></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>AFTER ESTABLISHING THE DAYS THAT WORK BEST FOR PEOPLE, WE WILL CHOOSE TWO DAYS OF THE WEEK (during this proposal''s stack, hopefully) AND CALL THEM "GENERAL ASSEMBLY." ON THE OTHER DAYS, WE WILL HOLD "DAILY ASSEMBLY."</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>If, for example, you have a proposal that, in the spirit of true consensus, should solicit the input of the greater movement, you''ll want to announce it at a General Assembly. If your proposal only concerns people at camp, or will likely affect a small range of stakeholders, and seems generally agreeable, it will matter less which day you propose it. Since the occupation represents an ever-changing entity, all proposals remain tentative anyway, if the General Assembly has input they can address that when they meet.\r\n\r\nSo, if some people absolutely can never make it on the days chosen for the General Assembly, that won''t mean exclusion from the "club." They can direct their energy into the working groups they care about, and, confident in our commitment to work together, use the working group, or a friend, or the internet, or any medium they like as their lisasion to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the future I''d like to see an even more organized assembly where we solicit announcements and proposals online, between GA''s, to stimulate much of the conversation in advance and help a wider range of people participate.\r\n\r\nLarger GA''s mean more people to help facilitate. We can finally divide facilitation responsibilities among roles like "vibes checker," and "internet stack taker," and "whiteboard squiggler," etc ...\r\n\r\nI announced this well in advance, so that I can schedule the discussion and hopeful passing of the proposal during an assembly most people can attend. We will take internet stack too, in an effort to give all stakeholder a voice. I will likely propose it at the Regional Assembly, since the decision, in a sense, affects everyone in the greater area, because they might want to attend our GA''s too. Also it will provide a good environment to improve our skills working with an important proposal.</blockquote>\r\n<a name="proposal-reduceGA"></a>\r\n<h1>Consensus-Forming Document:</h1>\r\n<iframe src="https://occupytampa.titanpad.com/18?sidebar=1&amp;fullScreen=1" frameborder="0" width="780" height="480"></iframe>', 'An Important Proposal for this Saturday''s General Assembly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-8', '', '', '2012-05-29 06:47:59', '2012-05-29 11:47:59', '', 23, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/05/29/23-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly will not operate from one location, rather, we ask that each occupation try to locate, and occupy, a space to allow our collective Assembly. We will rotate the responsibilities of hosting the Regional Assembly between the participating occupations.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa proposes to host the first Regional General Assembly on Saturday, June 2nd 2012 at our birth place: Gaslight Park, 410 N. Franklin St., Tampa, FL.\r\n\r\nThe Regional General Assembly will likely form the agenda for the first gathering on this date. We would like to propose that participants arrive at 11AM to prepare for the Assembly, which will start at 12.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of consensus, we ask that you please present the Regional General Assembly as a proposal to your city’s Occupation. We look forward to joining with you, and defending freedom from the government and corporations who want to take it away!\r\n\r\nYou have been urged to assert your power. Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nNow is that time.</blockquote>\r\n<h5>Long assemblies benefit from comfort. Bring chairs, perhaps a clipboard and notepad on which you can scribble your ideas while you wait for stack to reach you, that way you can get everything out with less stacking, and remember better what you want to say.</h5>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a name="plan-RGA"></a>\r\n<h4>Planning Document:</h4>\r\n<iframe src="http://occupytampa.titanpad.com/19?sidebar=1&amp;fullScreen=1" frameborder="0" width="780" height="480"></iframe>', 'Come to the Regional General Assembly this Saturday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '29-revision-14', '', '', '2012-05-29 08:01:17', '2012-05-29 13:01:17', '', 29, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/05/29/29-revision-14/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

They transport kidnapped monkeys from airports to laboratories, where the primates will be tortured and eventually killed. In May, the monkey traffickers were given two weeks to respond to a reasonably-phrased letter requesting they stop shipping primates. In July, nine activists, including ''Take Your Blinders Off'' from Orlando, protested peacefully at the traffickers'' home. We are working to bring the press this time and will continue showing up until Unique Carriers stops transporting kidnapped primates to Primate Products, Inc. 4101 Meredith Drive, Valrico, FL Contacts: Katie Christofilis/Vivian Taylor\r\n2 pm Mass Media: Enemy or Tool? Many radicals have a conflicted, even confused stance when it comes to the mass media. While corporate-owned media outlets are often dismissed as agents of distortion and propaganda, many radical actions (such as those associated with the RNC) seem intended to attract the attention of these outlets. This discussion will ask whether fundamental social critiques can be mounted through the mass media. It will also review the basics of media strategy for activists, and explore ways to retain the most possible control of your own messaging.\r\nCafé Hey David Morris\r\n4 pm Know Your Rights Riverfront Park Amphitheatre NLG\r\n7 pm Dinner &amp; General Assembly Voice of Freedom Park\r\n8.30 pm Occupy Tampa Movie Night "Vote for Jesus" with Vermin Supreme Voice of Freedom Park Occupy Tampa Education Workgroup</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\ntampafnb@gmail.com\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.resistrnc.org/" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.resistrnc.org/</a>', 'Food Not Bombs World Gathering', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'food-not-bombs-world-gathering', '', '', '2012-08-06 14:58:32', '2012-08-06 18:58:32', '', 0, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/?post_type=ai1ec_event&#038;p=278&#038;instance_id=', 0, 'ai1ec_event', '', 0),

On the moral front, we want to elevate housing to the status of a human right, and the Occupy Movement has finally started to work with other organizations, like “Take Back the Land,” to advance lasting cultural change.</p>\r\n<h3>Diversity of Tactics</h3>\r\n<p>The Declaration of the Occupation of New York City mentions:\r\n<blockquote>“They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, <strong>despite not having the original mortgage</strong>.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>The “Take Back The Land” approach focuses on <em>forcing a community conversation about the way we look at private property</em>, by demonstrating the immoral eviction process and encouraging communities to come together, defend those evictions, and control their own land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A complimentary approach refers to the second half of that sentence from the declaration ("despite not having the original mortgage").\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on bank fraud has a few advantages, namely (1) by educating people about the fraud, more families will have the tools they need to defend their homes in court; (2) by exposing the unprescedented nature of these crimes, the shit will hit the fan ... nay, the shit will splatter all over land ... soon. (3) this project needs an army of nerds, and for those who don''t want to risk arrest via other tactics, we''ve got just the thing for you!</p>\r\n<p>We want to help Occupiers and activist groups everywhere find this information and help them digest it. We want everyone to share their tactics, ideas, sucesses, and failures. We want to strengthen the movement. We want to give a voice to the voiceless: the one''s who blame themselves for their foreclosure, the ones who don''t know where to turn, the ones with no representation, the ones outmaneuvered by the banks (with their dirty tactics, unlimited financial resources, and, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/bank-of-america-too-crooked-to-fail-20120314" target="_blank">in the words of Matt Taibbi "royalty status."</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Time for a deep breath and perhaps a piss break)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This series will demonstrate how the banks intentionally manufactured this crisis before it started. Those on Wall Street have pulled off the "most massive transfer of wealth" in history, and by doing so, they''ve inflicted widespread suffering across communities thousands of miles away.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The largest transfer of wealth from the public to private sector is about to begin. The federal government will be bulk-selling the massive portfolio of foreclosed homes now owned by HUD, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private investors — vulture funds.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>So warned Roger Arnold, chief economist for ALM Advisors of Pasadena, California, in a <a href="http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/11/2011/huge-housing-bargain-not-you">column for RealMoney on August 11, 2011</a>, that first lifted the lid on this latest colossal scandal to come out of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\r\n<blockquote>“These homes,” wrote Arnold, “which are now the property of the U.S. government, the U.S. taxpayer, U.S. citizens collectively, are going to be sold to private investor conglomerates at extraordinarily large discounts to real value. You and I will not be allowed to participate. These investors will come from the private-equity and hedge-fund community, Goldman Sachs (GS) and its derivatives, as well as foreign sovereign wealth funds that can bring a billion dollars or more to each transaction.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, obviously, would have no trouble qualifying for the privilege of bidding in this fire sale for the super-rich. And the “Oracle of Omaha” appears to be more than casually interested in getting in on the game.</p>\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on March 20, 2012: “Warren Buffett, considered a sage investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said in an interview with CNBC-TV last month that he would buy up ‘a couple hundred thousand’ single-family homes if he could do so easily, given the high yields on rental investments.”</p>\r\n<p>The Ponzi Scheme:<br>\r\nThe research you will complete in this series will, among other things, teach you how to find patterns of foreclosures across communities and states, and these emerging patterns of fraud will help us embarrass those in government for their complicity with the 1%. No matter how you spin this, nobody can deny that there is fraud, fraud, fraud. Everywhere. http://www.alternet.org/story/154210/84_percent_of_san_francisco_foreclosures_fraudulent--why_are_bankers_still_getting_away_with_crimes</p>\r\n<p>The authors of this document (Tristan and Sylvia) believe that the foreclosure issue represents something central to the philosophy behind Occupy, and more actions about this issue seems like an ideal next step toward the revolution.</p>\r\n<blockquote>"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." - Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe housing tragedy and the public response to it operates on many fronts.

I have a hypothesis as to why this has happened, based on my own experiences wondering whether or not to go to GA:\r\n\r\nI attended several disappointingly small assemblies, including ones that had zero announcements and proposals.\r\n\r\nI attend General Assemblies hoping for stimulation: interesting announcements and proposals, interesting conversations, a chance to see my friends and make new ones, and a chance to find projects to participate in. If I doubt many people will show up, I doubt these things will happen.\r\n\r\nBy instilling confidence in a central time for GA, people will assume a better turnout and therefore attend. Attendance will slowly increase for the first few and will then spiral into much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nIn Toledo, a proposal came up to reduce GA frequency to Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. I worried that it would kill the vitality of our movement. But the results proved me wrong, GA attendance exploded.\r\n\r\nPeople then had energy to direct their attention to participating in the working groups. This represents the second stage of an Occupy. They usually start with large, disorganized assemblies and then organize into working groups. The General Assembly then becomes more of a reporting ground for the working groups to update each other, to announce new groups, and to pass grand proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, by losing the ability to have a meeting every day, we loose the ability to address daily problems, we loose the ability to remind each other what projects need help, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore the kernel of my proposal at this time goes like this:</blockquote>\r\n<h5></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>AFTER ESTABLISHING THE DAYS THAT WORK BEST FOR PEOPLE, WE WILL CHOOSE TWO DAYS OF THE WEEK (during this proposal''s stack, hopefully) AND CALL THEM "GENERAL ASSEMBLY." ON THE OTHER DAYS, WE WILL HOLD "DAILY ASSEMBLY."</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>If, for example, you have a proposal that, in the spirit of true consensus, should solicit the input of the greater movement, you''ll want to announce it at a General Assembly. If your proposal only concerns people at camp, or will likely affect a small range of stakeholders, and seems generally agreeable, it will matter less which day you propose it. Since the occupation represents an ever-changing entity, all proposals remain tentative anyway, if the General Assembly has input they can address that when they meet.\r\n\r\nSo, if some people absolutely can never make it on the days chosen for the General Assembly, that won''t mean exclusion from the "club." They can direct their energy into the working groups they care about, and, confident in our commitment to work together, use the working group, or a friend, or the internet, or any medium they like as their lisasion to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the future I''d like to see an even more organized assembly where we solicit announcements and proposals online, between GA''s, to stimulate much of the conversation in advance and help a wider range of people participate.\r\n\r\nLarger GA''s mean more people to help facilitate. We can finally divide facilitation responsibilities among roles like "vibes checker," and "internet stack taker," and "whiteboard squiggler," etc ...\r\n\r\nI announced this well in advance, so that I can schedule the discussion and hopeful passing of the proposal during an assembly most people can attend. We will take internet stack too, in an effort to give all stakeholder a voice. I will likely propose it at the Regional Assembly, since the decision, in a sense, affects everyone in the greater area, because they might want to attend our GA''s too. Also it will provide a good environment to improve our skills working with an important proposal.</blockquote>\r\n<a name="proposal-reduceGA"></a>\r\n<h4>Consensus-Forming Document:</h4>\r\n<iframe src="http://occupytampa.org/home/18-latest.html" frameborder="0" width="780" height="480"></iframe>', 'An Important Proposal for this Saturday''s General Assembly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-10', '', '', '2012-06-02 22:09:03', '2012-06-03 02:09:03', '', 23, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/02/23-revision-10/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I have a hypothesis as to why this has happened, based on my own experiences wondering whether or not to go to GA:\r\n\r\nI attended several disappointingly small assemblies, including ones that had zero announcements and proposals.\r\n\r\nI attend General Assemblies hoping for stimulation: interesting announcements and proposals, interesting conversations, a chance to see my friends and make new ones, and a chance to find projects to participate in. If I doubt many people will show up, I doubt these things will happen.\r\n\r\nBy instilling confidence in a central time for GA, people will assume a better turnout and therefore attend. Attendance will slowly increase for the first few and will then spiral into much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nIn Toledo, a proposal came up to reduce GA frequency to Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. I worried that it would kill the vitality of our movement. But the results proved me wrong, GA attendance exploded.\r\n\r\nPeople then had energy to direct their attention to participating in the working groups. This represents the second stage of an Occupy. They usually start with large, disorganized assemblies and then organize into working groups. The General Assembly then becomes more of a reporting ground for the working groups to update each other, to announce new groups, and to pass grand proposals.\r\n\r\nHowever, by losing the ability to have a meeting every day, we loose the ability to address daily problems, we loose the ability to remind each other what projects need help, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore the kernel of my proposal at this time goes like this:</blockquote>\r\n<h5></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>AFTER ESTABLISHING THE DAYS THAT WORK BEST FOR PEOPLE, WE WILL CHOOSE TWO DAYS OF THE WEEK (during this proposal''s stack, hopefully) AND CALL THEM "GENERAL ASSEMBLY." ON THE OTHER DAYS, WE WILL HOLD "DAILY ASSEMBLY."</strong></h5>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>If, for example, you have a proposal that, in the spirit of true consensus, should solicit the input of the greater movement, you''ll want to announce it at a General Assembly. If your proposal only concerns people at camp, or will likely affect a small range of stakeholders, and seems generally agreeable, it will matter less which day you propose it. Since the occupation represents an ever-changing entity, all proposals remain tentative anyway, if the General Assembly has input they can address that when they meet.\r\n\r\nSo, if some people absolutely can never make it on the days chosen for the General Assembly, that won''t mean exclusion from the "club." They can direct their energy into the working groups they care about, and, confident in our commitment to work together, use the working group, or a friend, or the internet, or any medium they like as their lisasion to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the future I''d like to see an even more organized assembly where we solicit announcements and proposals online, between GA''s, to stimulate much of the conversation in advance and help a wider range of people participate.\r\n\r\nLarger GA''s mean more people to help facilitate. We can finally divide facilitation responsibilities among roles like "vibes checker," and "internet stack taker," and "whiteboard squiggler," etc ...\r\n\r\nI announced this well in advance, so that I can schedule the discussion and hopeful passing of the proposal during an assembly most people can attend. We will take internet stack too, in an effort to give all stakeholder a voice. I will likely propose it at the Regional Assembly, since the decision, in a sense, affects everyone in the greater area, because they might want to attend our GA''s too. Also it will provide a good environment to improve our skills working with an important proposal.</blockquote>\r\n<a name="proposal-reduceGA"></a>\r\n<h4>Consensus-Forming Document:</h4>\r\n<iframe src="https://occupytampa.titanpad.com/18?sidebar=1&amp;fullScreen=1" frameborder="0" width="780" height="480"></iframe>', 'An Important Proposal for this Saturday''s General Assembly', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '23-revision-9', '', '', '2012-05-29 07:20:42', '2012-05-29 12:20:42', '', 23, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/05/29/23-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The system we seek to confront remains financed by large corporations, corporations who demonstrate no intention to disturb the status quo, corporations who will stop at nothing to protect their profits and their shareholders, no matter how much it hurts the rest of us.\r\n\r\nIn the Tampa Bay region, multiple Occupations stand in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street to demand an end to corporate greed, an end to corporate political contributions, and an end to a tax structure that fails to meet societal needs by ensuring tax cuts for the wealthiest 1%.\r\n\r\nThese goals bring us all together and motivate each of our General Assemblies to grow and flourish, but one question remains unanswered: How can we, the General Assemblies of the Tampa Bay region, use our collective voices to effect local change? What steps can we take to demonstrate real solidarity and communicate with each other? How do we improve our educational workshops to reach a broader audience?\r\n\r\nWith the eyes of the nation focusing on the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, we as Occupiers in one of the host cities have unique opportunities, roles, and responsibilities that we should handle in a manner that includes all of the regional occupations.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, the General Assembly of Occupy Tampa is reaching out to all of the neighboring General Assemblies to propose the creation of a "Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly," with a monthly gathering and day of action. The Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly will not operate from one location, rather, we ask that each occupation try to locate, and occupy, a space to allow our collective Assembly. We will rotate the responsibilities of hosting the Regional Assembly between the participating occupations.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa proposes to host the first Regional General Assembly on Saturday, June 2nd 2012 at our birth place: Gaslight Park, 410 N. Franklin St., Tampa, FL.\r\n\r\nThe Regional General Assembly will likely form the agenda for the first gathering on this date. We would like to propose that participants arrive at 11AM to prepare for the Assembly, which will start at 12.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of consensus, we ask that you please present the Regional General Assembly as a proposal to your city’s Occupation. We look forward to joining with you, and defending freedom from the government and corporations who want to take it away!\r\n\r\nYou have been urged to assert your power. Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nNow is that time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Schedule</h5>\r\n\r\n11am – Food Not Bombs will be serving brunch at Lykes Gaslight Park for meet and greet leading up to Tampa Bay Regional GA. Meet fellow occupiers from around the region share food, stories, ideas and laughs.\r\n\r\n12pm - Tampa Bay Regional GA – First assembly of Bay Area Occupies. Occupations from Bradenton, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, Lakeland and New Port Richey will be in attendance and we invite anyone that has interest in the Occupy Movement to be present and participate. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/383861784989481/">See the facebook event page</a>.

We are encouraging anyone that has interest in the future direction of Occupy Tampa to attend. One proposal that has been floating around a while is cutting General Assemblies to 2 nights a week. We will be deciding on this proposal and determine those nights and times at this General Assembly. Answer the survey on the right so we can best determine which days of the week to choose.\r\n\r\nWe should have a live feed of this GA too.\r\n\r\nFreindly Reccomnedation: We are planning a long day and would recomend bringing blankets to sit on for comfort. Bottled water - Ice (We should have coolers, but can always use extra!) and Banannas or other energy fruit/snacks and of course extras of any of those items can be sharred with all in attendance. Bring chairs, perhaps a clipboard and notepad on which you can scribble your ideas while you wait for stack to reach you, that way you can get everything out with less stacking, and remember better what you want to say.\r\n\r\nPeace, Love and Solidarity to you all !!!\r\n\r\n<a name="plan-RGA"></a><h4>Planning Document:</h4>\r\n<iframe src="http://occupytampa.titanpad.com/19?sidebar=1&amp;fullScreen=1" frameborder="0" width="780" height="480"></iframe>', 'Come to the Regional General Assembly this Saturday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '29-revision-16', '', '', '2012-06-01 20:14:00', '2012-06-02 00:14:00', '', 29, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/01/29-revision-16/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Battle lines emerge over Occupy Tampa camp\n\nBy Justin George, Times Staff Writer \nIn Print: Monday, July 9, 2012\n\n<img src="http://www.tampabay.com/multimedia/archive/00230/b4s_Occupy070912a_230016c.jpg" alt="null" />\n\nTAMPA — They say they came for the people, by the people, pushed out of downtown into Voice of Freedom Park in West Tampa.\n\nThey put up tents and shook neighbors'' hands, saying they weren''t here to occupy the community but become part of it.\n\nThe members of Occupy Tampa cleaned up litter, displaced drug dealers and planted a community garden.\n\nThen, late last month, came the petition saying they are no longer welcome. A July 19 City Council hearing has been scheduled to discuss the concerns.\n\nSure there have been problems, Occupy Tampa members acknowledge. Fights, drunks and garbage. But the good they think Occupy Tampa has sprinkled far outweighs the bad. And the protesters suspect a conspiracy:\n\nThey think development interests want the demonstrators out so the area can be redeveloped.\n\n"This person may have personal motives for this petition," activist Dave Gonzalez, 53, surmised.\n\nThe petition exposes divergent views inside and outside the community on a crucial question: Who knows what''s best for West Tampa?\n\n• • •\n\nIn December, tired of repeated police clashes at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, Occupy Tampa moved to a park at 2101 W Main St. It''s owned by Joe Redner, a strip-club proprietor and political activist who shares many of the group''s views.\n\nOver the last few months, many residents say Occupy Tampa has turned into a messy homeless camp.\n\nThe petition, signed by more than 100 people including West Tampa business owners and residents, asks city leaders and Redner to relocate Occupy Tampa. Free meals and resource sharing are robbing stores and restaurants of business, the petition claims.\n\nAround Occupy''s setup of tents, signs, tarps, a barbecue smoker and the U-shaped help desk are a handful of businesses, including a Stripper Wear shop, convenience store and barber shop.\n\nA Metro PCS across from the park sells $25 unlimited talk and text plans, as well as pocket digital scales and a smokeable herbal mix fashioned in the shape of 50-cent pieces.\n\n"They''re not really bothering us," said clerk Abraham Nakshabendi, 17. "They''re not real active, so I don''t know why they call themselves activists."\n\nAt Royal Crowns Barber Shop, barber Ben Baisden said he has no concerns. Neither does Denerio Everett at the printing business Dot Com.\n\n"They''re all right by me," he said.\n\nMain Street Groceries, which sells hair extensions, pretzels, condoms and an array of cheap cigars, often has demonstrators stop in for soda, chips and beer.\n\n"They don''t bother us," said Gina Welch, who runs the store. "They spend money every day. They may have problems over there. Right now, someone''s getting beat to death but they don''t bother us."\n\nAs she spoke one afternoon last week, a man indeed was cowering on the ground after a violent exchange. Tampa police labeled it a disturbance because no one wanted to press charges.\n\nCamp resident Joshua Bey, 40, who goes by Buddha, said the man came into the park drunk and propositioned people. He had also assaulted a pregnant woman. The skirmish followed.\n\nOutside problems do sometimes creep into the camp, activists Dave Martinez and Tristan Lear said. The camp is open to homeless people and anyone who wants to join the movement. Everyone has to follow a "safer space agreement" that includes no drinking, drugs or violence or behavior "that perpetuates oppression."\n\nRedner has given Occupy members the authority to report trespassers, and they do.\n\nMartinez and Lear said Occupy Tampa has made Voice of Freedom Park safer, though police records show officers have been called there 19 times since December. The site had just two calls in the same period a year before.\n\nOccupy members have invited the community to meetings and a barbecue to discuss the petition. They wrote an open letter saying they even share some of the same grievances.\n\n"We need your help," the letter said. "Rather than ask for your help, we''d like to turn the tables and ask you how WE can help YOU turn the campsite into the park that you would like to see it become. We want to blur the line that divides ''us'' from ''the community.'' "\n\nWhile they acknowledge problems, Occupy members believe the petition is really about a sign at the park. It features two white hands hovering above the silhouette of a black family: "Hands off West Tampa!"\n\n• • •\n\nIn February, the Urban Land Institute sent Tampa several recommendations for redeveloping downtown riverfront areas. It included demolishing the aging North Boulevard Homes, a 682-unit subsidized apartment complex in West Tampa, to make way for a development with businesses and mixed-income residents.\n\nThe vision, which could be years away if feasible, was endorsed by Mayor Bob Buckhorn. But it spurred fear in North Boulevard Homes that the complex was going to be bulldozed.\n\nOccupy Tampa heard the rumblings. Up went the sign.\n\nMike Vannetta, president of the Old West Tampa Neighborhood Association and crime watch, has publicly supported the redevelopment vision. He''s also being blamed by Occupy members for the City Council petition.\n\nVannetta said the petition started at a neighborhood association meeting after two nonmembers including Joe Robinson, a West Tampa engineer and Republican activist, complained the park had become a nuisance.\n\n"Our petition is strictly over Occupy there making a mess, making an eyesore and competing with some businesses," Vannetta said. "Long-term, I really wouldn''t want a tent city in that park. Politically, I really don''t care what they think and what they do. This is not a political issue with me. It''s a beautification issue."\n\nKimberly Poitier, owner of Kimist Barber Beauty on Main Street, signed the petition and said Occupy Tampa is driving away her customers, as well as investors who might create jobs.\n\n"Main Street is already known as a very bad area to begin with," she said. "We wanted redevelopment but now you have people bathing outside like Little House on the Prairie."\n\n• • •\n\nA week ago, Vannetta met with Occupy members, who quickly moved tents back so the blooming crape myrtles could be seen again. They also picked up garbage.\n\nIt was enough for him to rethink his position.\n\n"Ultimately, at this point," Vannetta said, "I don''t think they have to go. I''m just speaking for myself."\n\nVannetta even told Redner that his group might hold back presenting the petition.\n\nRedner, who remains an Occupy supporter, was adamant that the petition has to be presented. He wants council members to take back the responsibility of housing and protecting Occupy Tampa in a public park. "Where it belongs," he said.\n\nJustin George can be reached at jgeorge@tampabay.com or (813) 226-3368.', 'Nuisance or neighbors?

People not used to activism or progressive movements have come a long way, and we all still have far to go.\r\n\r\nThe issues at Voice of Freedom Park, and what used to be a fully functioning activist camp, have been prevalent and plentiful. They have been a disappointment, but not completely. Through the time we''ve spent dealing with camp issues (unfortunately, more so than the issues we wished we could have been dealing with), everyone I know that has consistently shown up have developed a bond and an air of patience that is required when dealing with the real situation "on the street".\r\n\r\nWe have not had the luxury of being in a city where activism has been the norm for generations; nor have we had the continued support of people who would have provided much needed assistance in organizing anyone that wishes to engage in the process of galvanizing The People.\r\n\r\nWhile the camp may have been a "social experiment", it was a very much needed wake-up call for what we''re up against politically, socially, economically, and ideologically. We''ve realized after all this time that we need to be disciplined if we ever hope to achieve our goals. As nice as it would be, "show up and hope shit gets done" will not cut it, everyone needs to be readily engaged and consistent and disciplined in our established principles.\r\n\r\nVoice of Freedom Park remains a symbol not just of what we continue to hope will be a space created for developmental activism and sociological and ideological change, but a symbol of what we as humans need to place importance on as far as what needs to be accomplished. We''ve straightened our priorities. Those that have participated in the past and kept a sense of impatience and disappointment when their ideas weren''t immediately and unquestionably assimilated, have not participated due to the arrogance received in a sterile, cookie cutter learning environment that has always produced more of the same, and resulted in more of the same in the world.\r\n\r\nI''m not saying "they''re wrong", nor am I saying "we''re right", but rather that we should all be present in this Social Petri Dish to see what ideas will bubble to the surface amidst all the human damage (internal and external). And it is happening.\r\n\r\nClearly if Occupy (and activism in general) was to have worked in the first few months it began, we would have seen the results of such ever since, but instead we have all finally realized that simply wanting something to change doesn''t change it, and even working towards that change doesn''t accomplish your goals in a few short months, location-specific drama or not. Our present generation''s impatience with the world is causing clashes of arrogance and ego, detriments to educated minds and detractors of ideas and formulating processes that would otherwise be very beneficial.\r\n\r\nWhen we were born to be obedient servants, when we''ve been groomed to be such all our lives, one can''t expect a group of people like that to immediately be on board with an idea they''ve never considered, and to expect such is fallaciously arrogant and egotistical - ideologies formulated by a corporatized, militaristic society that thrives on war and conflict, and breeds humans with these motivations in mind.\r\n\r\nWe are creating an activist space. We were blessed with the gift of having real-estate to do so, and we must continue. It''s not only imperative to the movement, it''s imperative to the people in this society who are affected by the lifeless structure that hinders and controls them to their detriment and to the benefit of individuals that will never understand what it''s like to be stood upon.\r\n\r\nWe are still here, and we need more activists here to help us create an air of creation, social change, and understanding of non-violent methodology. The foundation <strong><em>is</em></strong> solidifying.\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2417" title="578776_262123753891857_238844141_n" src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/578776_262123753891857_238844141_n.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="450" />\r\n\r\n- Anonymous', 'Occupy Tampa 3.0', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'occupy-tampa-3-0', '', '', '2012-07-08 13:40:49', '2012-07-08 17:40:49', '', 0, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/?p=2414', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Last Friday, police were so desperate to prevent a re-occupation of the foreclosed home that they surrounded the house with “30 Minneapolis police officers with batons” and “over two dozen marked and undercover squad cars and a paddy wagon.” Occupiers responded by laughing and signing songs… joyous in their struggle to elevate the home into an symbol of democratic resistance to the banks.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>Check out this episode of PBS NOW to learn more about the kind of work Max Rameau, Take Back the Land, etc. engage in:</h4>\r\n<center>\r\n<object width="512" height="308" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /><embed width="512" height="308" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /></object></center>', 'Come Learn How to Liberate Homes this Wednesday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1229-revision-8', '', '', '2012-06-09 01:42:10', '2012-06-09 05:42:10', '', 1229, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/09/1229-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Last Friday, police were so desperate to prevent a re-occupation of the foreclosed home that they surrounded the house with “30 Minneapolis police officers with batons” and “over two dozen marked and undercover squad cars and a paddy wagon.” Occupiers responded by laughing and signing songs… joyous in their struggle to elevate the home into an symbol of democratic resistance to the banks.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>Check out this episode of PBS NOW to learn more about the kind of work Max Rameau, Take Back the Land, etc. engage in:</h4>\r\n\r\n<object width="512" height="308" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /><embed width="512" height="308" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /></object>', 'Come Learn How to Liberate Homes this Wednesday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1229-revision-9', '', '', '2012-06-09 01:55:37', '2012-06-09 05:55:37', '', 1229, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/09/1229-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The system we seek to confront remains financed by large corporations, corporations who demonstrate no intention to disturb the status quo, corporations who will stop at nothing to protect their profits and their shareholders, no matter how much it hurts the rest of us.\r\n\r\nIn the Tampa Bay region, multiple Occupations stand in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street to demand an end to corporate greed, an end to corporate political contributions, and an end to a tax structure that fails to meet societal needs by ensuring tax cuts for the wealthiest 1%.\r\n\r\nThese goals bring us all together and motivate each of our General Assemblies to grow and flourish, but one question remains unanswered: How can we, the General Assemblies of the Tampa Bay region, use our collective voices to effect local change? What steps can we take to demonstrate real solidarity and communicate with each other? How do we improve our educational workshops to reach a broader audience?\r\n\r\nWith the eyes of the nation focusing on the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, we as Occupiers in one of the host cities have unique opportunities, roles, and responsibilities that we should handle in a manner that includes all of the regional occupations.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, the General Assembly of Occupy Tampa is reaching out to all of the neighboring General Assemblies to propose the creation of a "Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly," with a monthly gathering and day of action. The Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly will not operate from one location, rather, we ask that each occupation try to locate, and occupy, a space to allow our collective Assembly. We will rotate the responsibilities of hosting the Regional Assembly between the participating occupations.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa proposes to host the first Regional General Assembly on Saturday, June 2nd 2012 at our birth place: Gaslight Park, 410 N. Franklin St., Tampa, FL.\r\n\r\nThe Regional General Assembly will likely form the agenda for the first gathering on this date. We would like to propose that participants arrive at 11AM to prepare for the Assembly, which will start at 12.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of consensus, we ask that you please present the Regional General Assembly as a proposal to your city’s Occupation. We look forward to joining with you, and defending freedom from the government and corporations who want to take it away!\r\n\r\nYou have been urged to assert your power. Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nNow is that time.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Schedule</h5>\r\n\r\n11am – Food Not Bombs will be serving brunch at Lykes Gaslight Park for meet and greet leading up to Tampa Bay Regional GA. Meet fellow occupiers from around the region share food, stories, ideas and laughs.\r\n\r\n12pm - Tampa Bay Regional GA – First assembly of Bay Area Occupies. Occupations from Bradenton, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, Lakeland and New Port Richey will be in attendance and we invite anyone that has interest in the Occupy Movement to be present and participate. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/383861784989481/">See the facebook event page</a>. We will also have <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/occupy-tampa-live-feed">live feeds</a> available for those that can not attend.\r\n\r\nUndetermined Time (upon completion of Regional GA) – Occupy Tampa will march in Solidarity with <a href="http://occupywallst.org/article/night-falls-power-rises-montreal/">Montreal Student Protest</a>.

Last Friday, police were so desperate to prevent a re-occupation of the foreclosed home that they surrounded the house with “30 Minneapolis police officers with batons” and “over two dozen marked and undercover squad cars and a paddy wagon.” Occupiers responded by laughing and signing songs… joyous in their struggle to elevate the home into an symbol of democratic resistance to the banks.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>Check out this episode of PBS NOW to learn more about the kind of work Max Rameau, Take Back the Land, etc. engage in:</h4>\r\n\r\n<object width="512" height="308" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /><embed width="512" height="308" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /></object>', 'Come Learn How to Liberate Homes this Wednesday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1229-revision-15', '', '', '2012-06-10 03:36:14', '2012-06-10 07:36:14', '', 1229, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/10/1229-revision-15/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(2424, 2, '2012-07-08 13:26:59', '2012-07-08 17:26:59', 'The road has been long. It certainly hasn''t been easy. People not used to activism or progressive movements have come a long way, and we all still have far to go.\r\n\r\nThe issues at Voice of Freedom Park, and what used to be a fully functioning activist camp, have been prevalent and plentiful. They have been a disappointment, but not completely. Through the time we''ve spent dealing with camp issues (unfortunately, more so than the issues we wished we could have been dealing with), everyone I know that has consistently shown up have developed a bond and an air of patience that is required when dealing with the real situation "on the street".\r\n\r\nWe have not had the luxury of being in a city where activism has been the norm for generations; nor have we had the continued support of people who would have provided much needed assistance in organizing anyone that wishes to engage in the process of galvanizing The People.\r\n\r\nWhile the camp may have been a "social experiment", it was a very much needed wake-up call for what we''re up against politically, socially, economically, and ideologically. We''ve realized after all this time that we need to be disciplined if we ever hope to achieve our goals. As nice as it would be, "show up and hope shit gets done" will not cut it, everyone needs to be readily engaged and consistent and disciplined in our established principles.\r\n\r\nVoice of Freedom Park remains a symbol not just of what we continue to hope will be a space created for developmental activism and sociological and ideological change, but a symbol of what we as humans need to place importance on as far as what needs to be accomplished. We''ve straightened our priorities. Those that have participated in the past and kept a sense of impatience and disappointment when their ideas weren''t immediately and unquestionably assimilated, have not participated due to the arrogance received in a sterile, cookie cutter learning environment that has always produced more of the same, and resulted in more of the same in the world.\r\n\r\nI''m not saying "they''re wrong", nor am I saying "we''re right", but rather that we should all be present in this Social Petri Dish to see what ideas will bubble to the surface amidst all the human damage (internal and external). And it is happening.\r\n\r\nClearly if Occupy (and activism in general) was to have worked in the first few months it began, we would have seen the results of such ever since, but instead we have all finally realized that simply wanting something to change doesn''t change it, and even working towards that change doesn''t accomplish your goals in a few short months, location-specific drama or not. Our present generation''s impatience with the world is causing clashes of arrogance and ego, detriments to educated minds and detractors of ideas and formulating processes that would otherwise be very beneficial.\r\n\r\nWhen we were born to be obedient servants, when we''ve been groomed to be such all our lives, one can''t expect a group of people like that to immediately be on board with an idea they''ve never considered, and to expect such is fallaciously arrogant and egotistical - ideologies formulated by a corporatized, militaristic society that thrives on war and conflict, and breeds humans with these motivations in mind.\r\n\r\nWe are creating an activist space. We were blessed with the gift of having real-estate to do so, and we must continue. It''s not only imperative to the movement, it''s imperative to the people in this society who are affected by the lifeless structure that hinders and controls them to their detriment and to the benefit of individuals that will never understand what it''s like to be stood upon.\r\n\r\nWe are still here, and we need more activists here to help us create an air of creation, social change, and understanding of non-violent methodology. The foundation <strong><em>is</em></strong> solidifying.\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2417" title="578776_262123753891857_238844141_n" src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/578776_262123753891857_238844141_n-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" />\r\n\r\n- Anonymous', 'Occupy Tampa 3.0', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2414-revision-6', '', '', '2012-07-08 13:26:59', '2012-07-08 17:26:59', '', 2414, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/07/08/2414-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Last Friday, police were so desperate to prevent a re-occupation of the foreclosed home that they surrounded the house with “30 Minneapolis police officers with batons” and “over two dozen marked and undercover squad cars and a paddy wagon.” Occupiers responded by laughing and signing songs… joyous in their struggle to elevate the home into an symbol of democratic resistance to the banks.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>Check out this episode of PBS NOW to learn more about the kind of work Max Rameau, Take Back the Land, etc. engage in:</h4>\r\n\r\n<object width="512" height="308" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /><embed width="512" height="308" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.pbs.org/now/media_player/flvplayer1.swf" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="file=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/video/NOW-526-stream.mp4&amp;plugins=embed-1&amp;image=http://www-tc.pbs.org/now/shows/526/images/video-512.jpg" /></object>', 'Come Learn How to Liberate Homes this Wednesday!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1229-revision-16', '', '', '2012-06-10 03:38:46', '2012-06-10 07:38:46', '', 1229, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/10/1229-revision-16/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

On the moral front, we want to elevate housing to the status of a human right, and the Occupy Movement has finally started to work with other organizations, like “Take Back the Land,” to advance lasting cultural change.</p>\r\n<h3>Diversity of Tactics</h3>\r\n<p>The Declaration of the Occupation of New York City mentions:\r\n<blockquote>“They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, <strong>despite not having the original mortgage</strong>.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>The “Take Back The Land” approach focuses on <em>forcing a community conversation about the way we look at private property</em>, by demonstrating the immoral eviction process and encouraging communities to come together, defend those evictions, and control their own land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A complimentary approach refers to the second half of that sentence from the declaration ("despite not having the original mortgage").\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on bank fraud has a few advantages, namely (1) by educating people about the fraud, more families will have the tools they need to defend their homes in court; (2) by exposing the unprescedented nature of these crimes, the shit will hit the fan ... nay, the shit will splatter all over land ... soon. (3) this project needs an army of nerds, and for those who don''t want to risk arrest via other tactics, we''ve got just the thing for you!</p>\r\n<p>We want to help Occupiers and activist groups everywhere find this information and help them digest it. We want everyone to share their tactics, ideas, sucesses, and failures. We want to strengthen the movement. We want to give a voice to the voiceless: the one''s who blame themselves for their foreclosure, the ones who don''t know where to turn, the ones with no representation, the ones outmaneuvered by the banks (with their dirty tactics, unlimited financial resources, and, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/bank-of-america-too-crooked-to-fail-20120314" target="_blank">in the words of Matt Taibbi "royalty status."</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Time for a deep breath and perhaps a piss break)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This series will demonstrate how the banks intentionally manufactured this crisis before it started. Those on Wall Street have pulled off the "most massive transfer of wealth" in history, and by doing so, they''ve inflicted widespread suffering across communities thousands of miles away.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The largest transfer of wealth from the public to private sector is about to begin. The federal government will be bulk-selling the massive portfolio of foreclosed homes now owned by HUD, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private investors — vulture funds.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>So warned Roger Arnold, chief economist for ALM Advisors of Pasadena, California, in a <a href="http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/11/2011/huge-housing-bargain-not-you">column for RealMoney on August 11, 2011</a>, that first lifted the lid on this latest colossal scandal to come out of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\r\n<blockquote>“These homes,” wrote Arnold, “which are now the property of the U.S. government, the U.S. taxpayer, U.S. citizens collectively, are going to be sold to private investor conglomerates at extraordinarily large discounts to real value. You and I will not be allowed to participate. These investors will come from the private-equity and hedge-fund community, Goldman Sachs (GS) and its derivatives, as well as foreign sovereign wealth funds that can bring a billion dollars or more to each transaction.”</blockquote></p>\r\n<p>Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, obviously, would have no trouble qualifying for the privilege of bidding in this fire sale for the super-rich. And the “Oracle of Omaha” appears to be more than casually interested in getting in on the game.</p>\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on March 20, 2012: “Warren Buffett, considered a sage investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said in an interview with CNBC-TV last month that he would buy up ‘a couple hundred thousand’ single-family homes if he could do so easily, given the high yields on rental investments.”</p>\r\n<p>The Ponzi Scheme:<br>\r\nThe research you will complete in this series will, among other things, teach you how to find patterns of foreclosures across communities and states, and these emerging patterns of fraud will help us embarrass those in government for their complicity with the 1%. No matter how you spin this, nobody can deny that there is fraud, fraud, fraud. Everywhere. http://www.alternet.org/story/154210/84_percent_of_san_francisco_foreclosures_fraudulent--why_are_bankers_still_getting_away_with_crimes</p>\r\n<p>The authors of this document believe that the foreclosure issue represents something central to the philosophy behind Occupy, and more actions about this issue seems like an ideal next step toward the revolution.</p>\r\n<blockquote>"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." - Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe housing tragedy and the public response to it operates on many fronts.

The community rally that it is encompassed under wil be from 2 pm to 10 pm.</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=2118+W+Main+St+tampa+fl+33607&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2118+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.957695,-82.481639&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">2118 W Main St</span></a><br>Tampa, FL 33607</div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.956941,-82.481646&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=1hKPHidl_gxwLRGPwtWmtkDhWE8="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:00 PM - Tampa Food Not Bombs <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">Serving Food for the General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:30 PM - 8:30 PM <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>9 PM<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group</a> <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">Meeting</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">occupytampa.org event page</a> | <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group Page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=St.+Petersburg+Public+Library&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=280+5th+St+N,+St+Petersburg,+Pinellas,+Florida+33701&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.774431,-82.638602&amp;spn=0.010385,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.77478,-82.639802&amp;panoid=I2uaHfyQD59xgoRJMNQ1lA&amp;cbp=12,296.11,,0,0.11&amp;cid=14126228530745569930"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">St. Petersburg Public Library</span></a><div>280 5th Street North<br>St. Petersburg, FL 33701<br>(727) 893-7268</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.774832,-82.639946&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=O8F4AaL3KrQGJmXOUwu7a8rIUAg="></td></tr></table>\r\n', 'All Kinds of Things on Saturday', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1425-revision-34', '', '', '2012-06-16 01:29:17', '2012-06-16 05:29:17', '', 1425, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/16/1425-revision-34/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The community rally that it is encompassed under wil be from 2 pm to 10 pm.</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:00 PM - Tampa Food Not Bombs <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">Serving food for the General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:30 PM - 8:30 PM<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>9 PM<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group</a> <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">Meeting</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">occupytampa.org event page</a> | <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group Page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=St.+Petersburg+Public+Library&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=280+5th+St+N,+St+Petersburg,+Pinellas,+Florida+33701&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.774431,-82.638602&amp;spn=0.010385,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.77478,-82.639802&amp;panoid=I2uaHfyQD59xgoRJMNQ1lA&amp;cbp=12,296.11,,0,0.11&amp;cid=14126228530745569930"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">St. Petersburg Public Library</span></a><div>280 5th Street North<br>St. Petersburg, FL 33701<br>(727) 893-7268</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.774832,-82.639946&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=O8F4AaL3KrQGJmXOUwu7a8rIUAg="></td></tr></table>\r\n', 'All Kinds of Things on Saturday', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1425-revision-32', '', '', '2012-06-16 01:22:48', '2012-06-16 05:22:48', '', 1425, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/16/1425-revision-32/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The community rally that it is encompassed under wil be from 2 pm to 10 pm.</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=2118+W+Main+St+tampa+fl+33607&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2118+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.957695,-82.481639&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">2118 W Main St</span></a><br>Tampa, FL 33607</div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.956941,-82.481646&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=1hKPHidl_gxwLRGPwtWmtkDhWE8="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:00 PM - Tampa Food Not Bombs <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">Serving Food for the General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-food-not-bombs/?instance_id=406967">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>7:30 PM - 8:30 PM <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">General Assembly</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/general-assembly-2/?instance_id=410502">occupytampa.org event page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=Occupy+Tampa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2101+W+Main+St,+Tampa,+Florida+33607&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.956975,-82.479815&amp;spn=0.010368,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.957143,-82.481076&amp;panoid=nsNyfIQHKPjn2xIIdKTd8A&amp;cbp=12,355.06,,0,0.1&amp;cid=2045729716420883163"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">Occupy Tampa</span></a><div>2101 West Main Street<br>Tampa, FL 33607</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.957398,-82.481071&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=UxVsR8TQcN44GDZ2EZlmHYIF904="></td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n<h3>9 PM<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group</a> <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">Meeting</a></h3>\r\n<table><tr><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;">\r\n[<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/media-meeting/?instance_id=407491">occupytampa.org event page</a> | <a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/groups/media/">Media Working Group Page</a>]</td><td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top;"><div><a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=St.+Petersburg+Public+Library&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=280+5th+St+N,+St+Petersburg,+Pinellas,+Florida+33701&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=27.774431,-82.638602&amp;spn=0.010385,0.020084&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=27.77478,-82.639802&amp;panoid=I2uaHfyQD59xgoRJMNQ1lA&amp;cbp=12,296.11,,0,0.11&amp;cid=14126228530745569930"><span style="font-size:123%; font-weight:bold; ">St. Petersburg Public Library</span></a><div>280 5th Street North<br>St. Petersburg, FL 33701<br>(727) 893-7268</div></div><br><img src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;sensor=false&amp;markers=color:red%7C27.774832,-82.639946&amp;client=google-maps-sharing&amp;signature=O8F4AaL3KrQGJmXOUwu7a8rIUAg="></td></tr></table>\r\n', 'All Kinds of Things on Saturday', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1425-revision-36', '', '', '2012-06-16 01:33:39', '2012-06-16 05:33:39', '', 1425, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/16/1425-revision-36/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(2940, 2, '2012-07-16 19:13:42', '2012-07-16 23:13:42', 'TAMPA — The little park in the center of Main Street was a gift to the West Tampa community nine years ago, but some residents say they have never been able to use it.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.tampagov.net/dept_police/">Police</a> would roll up to the cobblestone entrance and tell people to move on, they claim, suspecting they were drinking or dealing drugs.\r\n\r\n"We couldn''t even sit in the park and enjoy it," said George Smith, who owns a barbershop nearby on Albany Street.\r\n\r\nBut seven months ago, a band of activists set up camp at the park, inviting the homeless, surrounding residents and anyone interested in fighting the "1 percent" to join them and their tent city. They were Occupy Tampa, and for months they truly occupied the park 24/7 brazenly, without fear of harassment.\r\n\r\nSome in the community saw a double standard: Police left the mostly white outsiders alone in the park while they had broomed the black residents away.\r\n\r\n"We haven''t even been able to use the park ourselves," Smith said. "They''re just lounging in the park."\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy reveals one part of the growing tension simmering between Occupy Tampa and West Tampa, an issue the City Council is scheduled to discuss Thursday.\r\n\r\nLike Smith, one of the originators of a petition to drive Occupy Tampa out, others in West Tampa acknowledge this perceived difference in police treatment. But before anyone else points to a racial divide, others in the neighborhood say they have no problem with a double standard because it has actually empowered them.\r\n\r\n• • •\r\n\r\nBefore Voice of Freedom Park existed at the corner of W Main Street and N Albany Avenue, it was just a couple of sandy lots where people parked to go to the nearby bars. In 2003, Joe Redner, owner of the Mons Venus strip club, noticed many of the neighborhood''s frequent troubles originated near the spot.\r\n\r\n"I kept reading about drugs being sold down there and problems," he said.\r\n\r\nHe drove down Main Street and saw people going into the neighborhood bars and coming out with pints or half pints of liquor that they''d drink on their car hoods. Redner had been clashing with the City Council at the time, and in West Tampa he saw an opportunity to show up city officials.\r\n\r\n"They should be buying up lots and building parks where people could congregate and make the community safer," he said.\r\n\r\nSo that''s what he did. He bought the empty lots, installed sprinklers, planted about a dozen trees, built several concrete benches and put in criss-crossing sidewalks through the park. It cost him $79,700.\r\n\r\nHe had workers maintain the park but largely left it in the hands of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Smith and other residents say, police told people to stop loitering there.\r\n\r\nIt''s a characterization that police dispute. In the year before Occupy Tampa arrived, there were just two police calls to the park and no arrests, city records show.\r\n\r\n"We can''t just trespass people there," police spokeswoman Andrea Davis said. "We never have been able to unless the owner of the property allows us to."\r\n\r\nAnd Redner said he has never called police to the park.\r\n\r\nBut Dee Jackson said he''s been shooed away before.\r\n\r\n"Get out of here now or you''re going to jail," he said officers have told him.\r\n\r\nWhen Occupy Tampa moved in, Jackson, 38, noticed how police treated the group differently. He also began to learn some reasons why.\r\n\r\n"Occupy knows the laws," Jackson said. "Occupy knows their rights."\r\n\r\nHe watched as activists pointed their camera phones at officers when police stopped someone on the street, and how they quoted laws as needed. When code enforcement officers came with complaints, Jackson said, he watched Occupy Tampa activists calmly clean the camp and quickly address concerns.\r\n\r\n"Code enforcement came over there trying to kick them out," he said. "But Occupy just complied."\r\n\r\nCommunity members began to learn that they didn''t need to run when police told them to move along at night on the Main Street sidewalks. There''s no curfew.\r\n\r\nThey learned that they didn''t have to leave the park if they weren''t doing anything wrong.\r\n\r\n"If it''s not their property, they can''t chase us out," said Bernard Williams, 49, a lifelong resident.\r\n\r\nPeople are getting braver, said longtime neighborhood activist Michelle Williams.\r\n\r\n"I have seen a bit of a double standard, but it is what it is," she said. "They need to be there. It''s a great cause, and I''m happy Joe Redner has allowed them to be in the park."\r\n\r\nOccupy members said one of their goals was to help residents take back their community.\r\n\r\n"The fact that we help people protect their rights in our vicinity means that the situation has improved," Occupy activist Tristan Lear said. "Improvement sounds better than nothing, to me. Maybe if word got out that people could safely congregate at OT, we help make that space a true commons, a ''<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/safer-spaces-agreement/">safer space</a>.'' "\r\n\r\nIf neighborhood residents haven''t been able to use the park in the past, activist Elizabeth Toms said, Occupy Tampa came to change that.\r\n\r\n"We had a barbecue last Saturday, and we invited tons of people into the park," Toms said. "If they haven''t used the park before, they were now."\r\n\r\n<em>Times researcher John Martin contributed to this report.

They transport kidnapped monkeys from airports to laboratories, where the primates will be tortured and eventually killed. In May, the monkey traffickers were given two weeks to respond to a reasonably-phrased letter requesting they stop shipping primates. In July, nine activists, including ''Take Your Blinders Off'' from Orlando, protested peacefully at the traffickers'' home. We are working to bring the press this time and will continue showing up until Unique Carriers stops transporting kidnapped primates to Primate Products, Inc. 4101 Meredith Drive, Valrico, FL Contacts: Katie Christofilis/Vivian Taylor\n2 pm Mass Media: Enemy or Tool? Many radicals have a conflicted, even confused stance when it comes to the mass media. While corporate-owned media outlets are often dismissed as agents of distortion and propaganda, many radical actions (such as those associated with the RNC) seem intended to attract the attention of these outlets. This discussion will ask whether fundamental social critiques can be mounted through the mass media. It will also review the basics of media strategy for activists, and explore ways to retain the most possible control of your own messaging.\nCafé Hey David Morris\n4 pm Know Your Rights Riverfront Park Amphitheatre NLG\n7 pm Dinner &amp; General Assembly Voice of Freedom Park\n8.30 pm Occupy Tampa Movie Night "Vote for Jesus" with Vermin Supreme Voice of Freedom Park Occupy Tampa Education Workgroup</wbr></wbr></wbr>\n\n</div>\n<div></div>\ntampafnb@gmail.com\n\n<a href="http://www.resistrnc.org/" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.resistrnc.org/</a>', 'Food Not Bombs World Gathering', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '278-autosave', '', '', '2012-08-06 14:59:35', '2012-08-06 18:59:35', '', 278, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/06/20/278-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Thinking it over (Leslie) That number is too high. We need to  a) get the site blueprint or plan to get the dimensions of VOF and try to grid out the sleeping space, or b) Get a tape measure and do it ourselves.\r\n\r\nFood/water distribution: we discussed FNB presence will alleviate some of the duties for this. Leslie suggested we contact Occupy Supply and see if we can get a quantity of bottled/ 1 gal jugs of water and perhaps some energy bars (or trail mix) we can give people who need food and water right away.\r\n\r\nPortapotties: We have two and it''s barely accommodating our needs now with just us on site. We need at least two more. Someone suggested asking Mr. Redner to provide the extra portapotties. Otherwise we have to get them and pay for them ourselves (can someone contact the current service and ask how much for the 5 days service?)\r\n\r\nGarbage collection: Gonzo suggested we get a dumpster from the City of Tampa, he found out we need a permit for it which someone has to go to City Hall and apply for and we have to pay for the dumpster too. Gonzo agreed to find out how much it will cost and procedure for getting it. Gonzo also suggested we get some containers from recyclables, he wants all the recyclables to dispose of himself.\r\n\r\nSafer Spaces policy: We agreed we need several large signs detailing our SSP, and it should be included with orientation packets. No decision was made re: who is making and posting the signs.\r\nGonzo mentioned we must keep sidewalks clear at all times per our usage policy for the park.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed we will wear identifying shirts as security/peacekeepers/welcome/ OT VOF Staff. Leslie has lot of white shirts that can be sprayed over (they have business logos on them that must be covered she has all sizes, about 100 shirts.)\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion going back to how many we can fit into the park for overnight sleeping. We agreed to post Quiet Hours 12 midnight to 8 am, so ppl can rest.  We will direct ppl wanting to stay up/party to go off site.  We discussed keeping a tally when ppl arrive at welcome desk and when we reach the cap number, no one else will be accepted for sleeping space. Each tally will start over the next morning day. No one can reserve space for coming days. There is no space for us to store ppl''s belongings. Everyone is responsible for keeping their stuff with them, and taking it with them when they get up at 8 am,\r\n\r\n3 present discussed their belief that our guests are experienced protesters and know how to behave in close quarters.\r\n\r\nWe concluded with a schedule of people volunteering for security shifts. The shifts are 8am-4pm, 4pm-12am, and 12 am- 8 am. We agreed to the schedule and noted we will try to recruit OT members to help out as this is a skeleton crew at best of 1 person on 8-4, and 2 each on 4-12 and 12-8.\r\n\r\nContact Alton at 813-650-1775 or Leslie at 813-965-3861 for questions, or to sign up for security shifts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Meeting Minutes 8/8/2012', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'security-meeting-minutes-882012', '', '', '2012-08-12 14:19:15', '2012-08-12 18:19:15', '', 0, '', 0, 'bp_doc', '', 0),

However within our own backyard, the Tampa Police killed 16-year-old Javon Neal. Numerous eyewitness accounts contradict the official narrative. Many in the community have raised questions about the incident and demand transparency, and above all, justice.\r\n\r\nOn this Saturday, July 28th, residents and activists will host an action outside of the District 3 Police Station from 10 AM until Noon. We call upon the members of Occupy Tampa to show their support. We call for the people to stand in solidarity with West Tampa and all those subject to police repression both in the streets of Tampa and worldwide.\r\n\r\nFrom WMNF:\r\n\r\nAn African-American teenage boy was shot and killed by two Tampa Police officers Sunday night in Tampa Heights. Police reports say sixteen-year-old Javon Neal was armed with a gun, but some witnesses are disputing that claim. Today some activists called on the community to demand justice for the slain boy. Life Malcolm said residents of predominantly black communities should think twice before calling the police for help.\r\n\r\n“Because their way of solving our problems is leaving one of our children dead. That’s what they do every time they come into our community. So, you’re absolutely right, they say they responded to a call but right now we’re here educating our people to stop talking to the police, stop calling the police because every time they come to our neighborhood we lose something, either our property, our freedom, or in last night’s case, our life.”\r\n\r\nMalcolm, who is a member of the Black People’s Advancement and Defense Organization, led a group of five activists in a heated speech about just how much trouble increased police presence is in low-income areas during a protest in front of the front of Tampa Police’s District Three office.\r\n\r\nHe said there isn’t anything that can be done to help Javon Neal, the teenager who was shot by police. Instead Malcolm said it’s a wake up call to the black community that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n“Out with police occupation and in with economic development, that’s what we want. No police. Economic Development. So that’s a specific concern because if the police were not always in our neighborhood – we live like they did in Nazi Germany. We have police around us all the time. If you look like you have a wallet in your hand or a cell phone in your hand you might get shot. If you turn around too fast, you might get shot. If you don’t turn around fast enough, you might get shot. If you stay in the car, you might get shot. So, we want the end of police occupation and we want to see some economic development.”\r\n\r\nThe fatal shooting occurred after a citizen called the Tampa Police Department to report gunfire. According to Laura McElroy, spokesperson for the department, it was the fourth time police responded to the Central Court Apartments in Tampa Heights that day. McElroy said police were investigating a possible shooting and when they arrived at the apartment complex, officers found Javon Neal, who fit the description of the suspect from the previous incident. She said the officers gave orders for him to stop, but he continued to flee. McElroy said according to police reports, Neal removed a pistol-grip shotgun from his pants and pointed it at the officers. That’s when they fired.\r\n\r\n“The bottom line is this is a very dangerous assault-style weapon. It absolutely has no business being in the hands of a teenager. And that really is the crux of the tragedy of this shooting, that a teenager was armed with such a menacing assault-style rifle. Not only was he armed with it, but he pointed it at two police officers who, if they had not fired, would probably not be with us today.”\r\n\r\nBut witnesses at the scene don’t remember it that way. Kemon Ford, Neal’s 12-year-old brother witnessed the shooting. He said everything happened too fast, but he never saw a gun.\r\n\r\n“So then they got upstairs and then he looked backed and saw them and then they was doing at him like this with the gun then he put his hands up. Then they got up there and then they had shot him.”\r\n\r\nHorrett Traban is one of Neal’s closest friends. He watched the horror unfold as police arrived and said their accounts of the incident just don’t match up.\r\n\r\n“He was standing in the parking lot with me and my family because somebody else had shot a pistol right down the street. So, he was like ‘let me get in the house before they go…’ But I ain’t think he was going to go in the house, so I’m talking to my cousin. When I turn around, when they say ‘there go the police’, I’m looking around and he gone. He already gone. And if he was already gone he could have made it into the house if he was running.”\r\n\r\nSome witnesses said they saw Neal place his hands over his head, but other witnesses have said that was someone else. Others questioned why the gun was found on the ground and not on the third floor where Neal was shot. Tampa Police’s McElroy said that just proves that Neal pointed the gun at officers because he would have had to have been holding the gun above the four-foot tall guard rail. Michele Williams, a member of the New Black Panther Party, an activist group, said there is a way to clear up the inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n“In the apartment complex there are two video cameras in every stairwell. So it caught everything that transpired in Central Court Apartments last night and that’s what I’m asking. I’m asking that they do something about this and I’m asking that they reveal that tape to us.”\r\n\r\nMcElroy, spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department said she would not release that evidence but it has been turned over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as part of the ongoing investigation.\r\n\r\n“We have a sixteen year old who has been killed so this is a very serious investigation and that, all that video if there is any that actually captures the shooting or any portion of it would be part of that. So, it’s going to be a very thorough investigation. I can’t say exactly how long it will take.”\r\n\r\nPolice said the two officers involved were Shannon Murphy and Gregory Pryor. Both have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation which police say is standard procedure. Michele Williams from the New Black Panther Party wants justice for Javon Neal’s shooting not just because she thinks officers were wrong about him, but because of how they handled it afterward.\r\n\r\n“I physically see white police officers high-fiving one another. That disturbed me. It’s already surfacing on YouTube and Facebook right now that the police were high-fiving one another – we got him.”\r\n\r\nJavon Neal’s mother, Kethessa Fordoms, lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred. She said she had asked Neal to stay inside because there had been gunshots earlier in the day, but she eventually let her guard down. Fordoms choked back tears as she described her son as just a boy. According to her, he wasn’t running from police officers, he was playing a game with some friends.\r\n\r\n“He had never been in trouble, he never started trouble. He mainly stayed to his self. And he was playing with someone inside the complex and the whole time the cops thought that he was running from them and that wasn’t the case. He was playing and they just gunned my son down for no reason.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the small protest in front of Tampa Police’s district three office, about 40 people gathered at the Central Court Apartments for another demonstration. At one point, two individuals began arguing about the incident. One of the unidentified individuals was accusing the other of being the person who actually had a gun and blamed him for Javon Neal’s shooting. No one would comment on the argument.\r\n\r\nWhen: 10AM-Noon.\r\n\r\nWhere: District 3 Police Station, 3808 North 22nd Street, Tampa, FL  33610\r\n\r\nAfter the demonstration, remember to attend the Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly @ South Straub Park in Saint Petersburg!\r\n\r\n<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/nvda-action-javon-neal/?instance_id=423630">Occupytampa.org event page</a>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/112208978924250/">Facebook event page</a>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style="vertical-align: top;" valign="top">\r\n<h3><a href="http://www.wmnf.org/news_stories/teen-shot-by-tampa-police-leaves-witnesses-outraged"><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/medium3.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="left" hspace="5" />WMNF 88.5 FM News: Teen shot by Tampa Police leaves witnesses outraged</a></h3>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAfter the demonstration, remember to attend the Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly @ South Straub Park in Saint Petersburg!', 'Demand transparency from the Tampa Police!

(2415, 2, '2012-07-08 12:46:51', '2012-07-08 16:46:51', 'The road has been long.  It certainly hasn''t been easy.  People not used to activism or progressive movements have come a long way, and we all still have far to go.\n\nThe issues at Voice of Freedom Park, and what used to be a fully functioning activist camp, have been prevalent and plentiful.  They have been a disappointment, but not completely.  Through the time we''ve spent dealing with camp issues (unfortunately, more so than the issues we wished we could have been dealing with), everyone I know that has consistently shown up have developed a bond and an air of patience that is required when dealing with the real situation "on the street". \n\nWe have not had the luxury of being in a city where activism has been the norm for generations; nor have we had the continued support of people who would have provided much needed assistance in organizing anyone that wishes to engage in the process of galvanizing The People. \n\nWhile the camp may have been a "social experiment", it was a very much needed wake-up call for what we''re up against politically, socially, economically, and ideologically.  We''ve realized after all this time that we need to be disciplined if we ever hope to achieve our goals.  As nice as it would be, "show up and hope shit gets done" will not cut it, everyone needs to be readily engaged and consistent and disciplined in our established principles.\n\nVoice of Freedom Park remains a symbol not just of what we continue to hope will be a space created for developmental activism and sociological and ideological change, but a symbol of what we as humans need to place importance on as far as what needs to be accomplished.  We''ve straightened our priorities.  Those that have participated in the past and kept a sense of impatience and disappointment when their ideas weren''t immediately and unquestionably assimilated, have not participated due to the arrogance received in a sterile, cookie cutter learning environment that has always produced more of the same, and resulted in more of the same in the world. \n\nI''m not saying "they''re wrong", nor am I saying "we''re right", but rather that we should all be present in this Social Petri Dish to see what ideas will bubble to the surface amidst all the human damage (internal and external).  And it is happening.\n\n \n\nClearly if Occupy (and activism in general) was to have worked in the first few months it began, we would have seen the results of such ever since, but instead we have all finally realized that simply wanting something to change doesn''t change it, and even working towards that change doesn''t accomplish your goals in a few short months, location-specific drama or not.  Our present generation''s impatience with the world is causing clashes of arrogance and ego, detriments to educated minds and detractors of ideas and formulating processes that would otherwise be very beneficial.\n\n \n\nWhen we were born to be obedient servants, when we''ve been groomed to be such all our lives, one can''t expect a group of people like that to immediately be on board with an idea they''ve never considered, and to expect such is fallaciously arrogant and egotistical - ideologies formulated by a corporatized, militaristic society that thrives on war and conflict, and breeds humans with these motivations in mind.\n\n \n\nWe are creating an activist space.  We were blessed with the gift of having real-estate to do so, and we must continue.  It''s not only imperative to the movement, it''s imperative to the people in this society who are affected by the lifeless structure that hinders and controls them to their detriment and to the benefit of individuals that will never understand what it''s like to be stood upon.\n\n \n\nWe are still here, and we need more activists here to help us create an air of creation, social change, and understanding of non-violent methodology.

Ask anyone behaving in this manner to leave immediately. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">Everyone entering this space has a responsibility to uphold these values. Know them and take proactive steps keep this a safer space.</span>\r\n<h4><span style="color: #000000;">Remediation Steps: </span></h4>\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">Make a sincere effort to avoid the Police. You don’t want them to enter the site without a warrant. They can make things much worse, for people with warrants, for undocumented immigrants, for survivors of police violence, and for most living things. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">We should try to keep as many on-site mediators as we can, which means training new mediators and helping existing ones improve their skills. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">Mediators staffing the site maintain the power to enforce safer space rules with a primary concern for executing the wishes of the victims. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">Again, anyone engaging in violence, anyone not respecting the mediation process, will leave immediately.  When the mediator needs to make a decision to give the benefit of the doubt to someone who has engaged in abusive behavior, or to support the survivor, they will give preference to the survivor. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">This policy intends to reject the status quo, the rape culture and patriarchy which surrounds us and threatens our movement. Rape culture refers to a culture that condones sexual violence, excuses it, and even encourages it. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #000000;">Most of the time we ignore instances of oppression, violence, and rape.

An influx of police vehicles soon followed. The well-recognized white Crown Victorias then joined in to create an unambiguous parade of police power. Police involved were both plain-clothed and uniformed.\r\n\r\nAs the night progressed, up to 20 police officers parked their cars within sight of Voice of Freedom Park and proceeded to walk up and down the public sidewalks. 5 police officers then began circling the Occupy Tampa camp in an authoritative and intimidating manner. Two of these police officers entered the park, were informed that the park was private and were asked to leave. Other officers began searching private property throughout the West Tampa area without permission of the property owners, without warrants, and without probable cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers walked through the park a second, and even third time without permission, conducting multiple searches in the process, they clearly violated the Constitution''s Fourth Amendment, disrespecting the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The police officers did not have probable cause or display a warrant of any type to enter Voice of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, within full view of the camp, the police pulled over passing vehicles without any justification, searching nearly every vehicle that entered the area. In complete disregard for public safety, the officers shined their flashlights into the windshields of oncoming traffic, presumably blinding drivers. Unwilling to be subjected to illegal pullovers and searches themselves, the Occupiers present did not feel free to leave the neighborhood and stayed to witness the entire operation.\r\n\r\nIf this type of illegal behavior from the police continues, the police department and the city of Tampa can expect internal affairs complaints, criminal charges, and civil lawsuits.\r\n\r\nPeople clearly upset at this blatant misuse of city resources include West Tampa business owners and workers who lost patrons due to these intimidation tactics. Occupy Tampa stands in solidarity with the residents and businesses of West Tampa against this police intimidation and harassment.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa would like to invite the news media to speak with the members of Occupy Tampa who witnessed these events. We will hold a press conference on Monday at 5pm. \r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa’s “cop watch” group attempted to film as much of the police behavior as possible. Anyone interested in these videos can send an email to media@occupytampa.org.\r\n\r\nVictims, witnesses, and anyone with additional footage of these events, please feel free to contact tampacommunity@hushmail.com or call (646) 470-1639 and leave a message.\r\n\r\nPress contact:\r\nmedia@occupytampa.org\r\n\r\nZoe Alif:\r\nzoealif@gmail.com\r\n\r\nTim Grantham:\r\ntimothy.p.grantham@gmail.com\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nUpdate: <a href="http://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/watch-police-descend-occupy-tampa-camp">Watch: Police Descend on Occupy Tampa Camp | WUSF News</a>.', 'Statement on the Police Misconduct in West Tampa on the Evening of 8/17/2012', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'statement-on-the-police-misconduct-in-west-tampa-on-the-evening-of-8172012', '', '', '2012-08-22 22:54:03', '2012-08-23 02:54:03', '', 0, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/?p=3755', 0, 'post', '', 2),

On the local front, corporate energy giants and Republican politicians have pushed to open Florida’s coast to off-shore drilling for oil and gas, permitted thousands of megawatts of new fossil fuel power plants in the state, and collaborated on plans to <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2011/20110419periana.html" target="_blank">fuse the biotech industry with energy giants</a>. On the national agenda, Republican politicians and lobbyists are promising industry heads support for tar sands exploration, gas fracking, coal mining and new nukes.\r\n\r\nMost groups planning to protest the Republican National Convention next week have focused on the wealth gap and the economy in general. But the history of failed civilizations show us that economic crises begin and end with ecological crisis.\r\n\r\nOur environmental message of protecting the planet from industrial pillage is needed here and now, more than ever.\r\n\r\nAll of us working on issues of pollution, water, development, energy, climate, greed, and the corruption that ties it all together, should be out in the streets of Tampa and St. Pete next week. (And out to protest the <a href="http://wallstsouth.org/" target="_blank">Democratic Convention the following week in North Carolina</a>, for most of the same reasons.)\r\n\r\nEEF! plans to have a presence throughout the RNC events. In particular, local organizers with <a href="http://resistrnc.org/" target="_blank">ResistRNC.org</a> in Tampa have called for August 30th to have a theme “promoting Environmental efforts.” We invite other environmental activists from across Florida and beyond to join us in taking action on this day to expose and confront the ecocidal elite.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be having an open meeting for those in South Florida wishing to discuss plans and make props for the RNC on August 22, 5pm at the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thenightheron" target="_blank">Night Heron Grassroots Activist Center. </a>\r\n\r\nWe may also re-convene in Tampa/St. Pete on the 29th to discuss plans for the 30th, Details TBA.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a series of flyers, posters and other EF! literature to circulate during the week. Please get in contact if you are interested to assist with producing or distributing these.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, EEF! plans to participate in the scheduled marches and rallies (see list below), and to stay flexible for opportunities to express our solidarity with other movements and our outrage at the industrial nightmare driven by the corporate politics represented by the RNC.\r\n\r\nGet in touch: <em>evergladesearthfirst [at] gmail.com</em>\r\n<h3><strong>Anti-RNC events we know abou:</strong></h3>\r\n<strong>All Week</strong>\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa and World Food Not Bombs gathering site, for food and tent space.

People not used to activism or progressive movements have come a long way, and we all still have far to go.\r\n\r\nThe issues at Voice of Freedom Park, and what used to be a fully functioning activist camp, have been prevalent and plentiful.  They have been a disappointment, but not completely.  Through the time we''ve spent dealing with camp issues (unfortunately, more so than the issues we wished we could have been dealing with), everyone I know that has consistently shown up have developed a bond and an air of patience that is required when dealing with the real situation "on the street". \r\n\r\nWe have not had the luxury of being in a city where activism has been the norm for generations; nor have we had the continued support of people who would have provided much needed assistance in organizing anyone that wishes to engage in the process of galvanizing The People. \r\n\r\nWhile the camp may have been a "social experiment", it was a very much needed wake-up call for what we''re up against politically, socially, economically, and ideologically.  We''ve realized after all this time that we need to be disciplined if we ever hope to achieve our goals.  As nice as it would be, "show up and hope shit gets done" will not cut it, everyone needs to be readily engaged and consistent and disciplined in our established principles.\r\n\r\nVoice of Freedom Park remains a symbol not just of what we continue to hope will be a space created for developmental activism and sociological and ideological change, but a symbol of what we as humans need to place importance on as far as what needs to be accomplished.  We''ve straightened our priorities.  Those that have participated in the past and kept a sense of impatience and disappointment when their ideas weren''t immediately and unquestionably assimilated, have not participated due to the arrogance received in a sterile, cookie cutter learning environment that has always produced more of the same, and resulted in more of the same in the world. \r\n\r\nI''m not saying "they''re wrong", nor am I saying "we''re right", but rather that we should all be present in this Social Petri Dish to see what ideas will bubble to the surface amidst all the human damage (internal and external).  And it is happening.\r\n\r\nClearly if Occupy (and activism in general) was to have worked in the first few months it began, we would have seen the results of such ever since, but instead we have all finally realized that simply wanting something to change doesn''t change it, and even working towards that change doesn''t accomplish your goals in a few short months, location-specific drama or not.  Our present generation''s impatience with the world is causing clashes of arrogance and ego, detriments to educated minds and detractors of ideas and formulating processes that would otherwise be very beneficial.\r\n\r\nWhen we were born to be obedient servants, when we''ve been groomed to be such all our lives, one can''t expect a group of people like that to immediately be on board with an idea they''ve never considered, and to expect such is fallaciously arrogant and egotistical - ideologies formulated by a corporatized, militaristic society that thrives on war and conflict, and breeds humans with these motivations in mind.\r\n\r\nWe are creating an activist space.  We were blessed with the gift of having real-estate to do so, and we must continue.  It''s not only imperative to the movement, it''s imperative to the people in this society who are affected by the lifeless structure that hinders and controls them to their detriment and to the benefit of individuals that will never understand what it''s like to be stood upon.\r\n\r\nWe are still here, and we need more activists here to help us create an air of creation, social change, and understanding of non-violent methodology.

A July 19 City Council hearing has been scheduled to discuss the concerns.\n\nSure there have been problems, Occupy Tampa members acknowledge. Fights, drunks and garbage. But the good they think Occupy Tampa has sprinkled far outweighs the bad. And the protesters suspect a conspiracy:\n\nThey think development interests want the demonstrators out so the area can be redeveloped.\n\n"This person may have personal motives for this petition," activist Dave Gonzalez, 53, surmised.\n\nThe petition exposes divergent views inside and outside the community on a crucial question: Who knows what''s best for West Tampa?\n\n• • •\n\nIn December, tired of repeated police clashes at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, Occupy Tampa moved to a park at 2101 W Main St. It''s owned by Joe Redner, a strip-club proprietor and political activist who shares many of the group''s views.\n\nOver the last few months, many residents say Occupy Tampa has turned into a messy homeless camp.\n\nThe petition, signed by more than 100 people including West Tampa business owners and residents, asks city leaders and Redner to relocate Occupy Tampa. Free meals and resource sharing are robbing stores and restaurants of business, the petition claims.\n\nAround Occupy''s setup of tents, signs, tarps, a barbecue smoker and the U-shaped help desk are a handful of businesses, including a Stripper Wear shop, convenience store and barber shop.\n\nA Metro PCS across from the park sells $25 unlimited talk and text plans, as well as pocket digital scales and a smokeable herbal mix fashioned in the shape of 50-cent pieces.\n\n"They''re not really bothering us," said clerk Abraham Nakshabendi, 17. "They''re not real active, so I don''t know why they call themselves activists."\n\nAt Royal Crowns Barber Shop, barber Ben Baisden said he has no concerns. Neither does Denerio Everett at the printing business Dot Com.\n\n"They''re all right by me," he said.\n\nMain Street Groceries, which sells hair extensions, pretzels, condoms and an array of cheap cigars, often has demonstrators stop in for soda, chips and beer.\n\n"They don''t bother us," said Gina Welch, who runs the store. "They spend money every day. They may have problems over there. Right now, someone''s getting beat to death but they don''t bother us."\n\nAs she spoke one afternoon last week, a man indeed was cowering on the ground after a violent exchange. Tampa police labeled it a disturbance because no one wanted to press charges.\n\nCamp resident Joshua Bey, 40, who goes by Buddha, said the man came into the park drunk and propositioned people. He had also assaulted a pregnant woman. The skirmish followed.\n\nOutside problems do sometimes creep into the camp, activists Dave Martinez and Tristan Lear said. The camp is open to homeless people and anyone who wants to join the movement. Everyone has to follow a "safer space agreement" that includes no drinking, drugs or violence or behavior "that perpetuates oppression."\n\nRedner has given Occupy members the authority to report trespassers, and they do.\n\nMartinez and Lear said Occupy Tampa has made Voice of Freedom Park safer, though police records show officers have been called there 19 times since December. The site had just two calls in the same period a year before.\n\nOccupy members have invited the community to meetings and a barbecue to discuss the petition. They wrote an open letter saying they even share some of the same grievances.\n\n"We need your help," the letter said. "Rather than ask for your help, we''d like to turn the tables and ask you how WE can help YOU turn the campsite into the park that you would like to see it become. We want to blur the line that divides ''us'' from ''the community.'' "\n\nWhile they acknowledge problems, Occupy members believe the petition is really about a sign at the park. It features two white hands hovering above the silhouette of a black family: "Hands off West Tampa!"\n\n• • •\n\nIn February, the Urban Land Institute sent Tampa several recommendations for redeveloping downtown riverfront areas. It included demolishing the aging North Boulevard Homes, a 682-unit subsidized apartment complex in West Tampa, to make way for a development with businesses and mixed-income residents.\n\nThe vision, which could be years away if feasible, was endorsed by Mayor Bob Buckhorn. But it spurred fear in North Boulevard Homes that the complex was going to be bulldozed.\n\nOccupy Tampa heard the rumblings. Up went the sign.\n\nMike Vannetta, president of the Old West Tampa Neighborhood Association and crime watch, has publicly supported the redevelopment vision. He''s also being blamed by Occupy members for the City Council petition.\n\nVannetta said the petition started at a neighborhood association meeting after two nonmembers including Joe Robinson, a West Tampa engineer and Republican activist, complained the park had become a nuisance.\n\n"Our petition is strictly over Occupy there making a mess, making an eyesore and competing with some businesses," Vannetta said. "Long-term, I really wouldn''t want a tent city in that park. Politically, I really don''t care what they think and what they do. This is not a political issue with me. It''s a beautification issue."\n\nKimberly Poitier, owner of Kimist Barber Beauty on Main Street, signed the petition and said Occupy Tampa is driving away her customers, as well as investors who might create jobs.\n\n"Main Street is already known as a very bad area to begin with," she said. "We wanted redevelopment but now you have people bathing outside like Little House on the Prairie."\n\n• • •\n\nA week ago, Vannetta met with Occupy members, who quickly moved tents back so the blooming crape myrtles could be seen again. They also picked up garbage.\n\nIt was enough for him to rethink his position.\n\n"Ultimately, at this point," Vannetta said, "I don''t think they have to go. I''m just speaking for myself."\n\nVannetta even told Redner that his group might hold back presenting the petition.\n\nRedner, who remains an Occupy supporter, was adamant that the petition has to be presented. He wants council members to take back the responsibility of housing and protecting Occupy Tampa in a public park.

An influx of police vehicles soon followed. The well-recognized white Crown Victorias then joined in to create an unambiguous parade of police power. Police involved were both plain-clothed and uniformed.\r\n\r\nAs the night progressed, up to 20 police officers parked their cars within sight of Voice of Freedom Park and proceeded to walk up and down the public sidewalks. 5 police officers then began circling the Occupy Tampa camp in an authoritative and intimidating manner. Two of these police officers entered the park, were informed that the park was private and were asked to leave. Other officers began searching private property throughout the West Tampa area without permission of the property owners, without warrants, and without probable cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers walked through the park a second, and even third time without permission, conducting multiple searches in the process, they clearly violated the Constitution''s Fourth Amendment, disrespecting the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The police officers did not have probable cause or display a warrant of any type to enter Voice of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, within full view of the camp, the police pulled over passing vehicles without any justification, searching nearly every vehicle that entered the area. In complete disregard for public safety, the officers shined their flashlights into the windshields of oncoming traffic, presumably blinding drivers. Unwilling to be subjected to illegal pullovers and searches themselves, the Occupiers present did not feel free to leave the neighborhood and stayed to witness the entire operation.\r\n\r\nIf this type of illegal behavior from the police continues, the police department and the city of Tampa can expect internal affairs complaints, criminal charges, and civil lawsuits.\r\n\r\nPeople clearly upset at this blatant misuse of city resources include West Tampa business owners and workers who lost patrons due to these intimidation tactics. Occupy Tampa stands in solidarity with the residents and businesses of West Tampa against this police intimidation and harassment.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa would like to invite the news media to speak with the members of Occupy Tampa who witnessed these events. We will hold a press conference on Monday at 5pm. \r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa’s “cop watch” group attempted to film as much of the police behavior as possible. Anyone interested in these videos can send an email to media@occupytampa.org.\r\n\r\nVictims, witnesses, and anyone with additional footage of these events, please feel free to contact tampacommunity@hushmail.com or call (646) 470-1639 and leave a message.\r\n\r\nPress contact:\r\nmedia@occupytampa.org\r\n\r\nZoe Alif:\r\nzoealif@gmail.com\r\n\r\nTim Grantham:\r\ntimothy.p.grantham@gmail.com\r\n', 'Statement on the Police Misconduct in West Tampa on the Evening of 8/17/2012', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3755-revision-6', '', '', '2012-08-19 22:03:12', '2012-08-20 02:03:12', '', 3755, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/19/3755-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

"I wanted to come and support the cause, corporations need to share the money" said Blackhawk. Hundreds of activists affiliated with the ''Occupy Wall Street'' demonstrations have been living in a park in the Financial District near Wall Street. The activists have been gradually converging on the financial district over the past two weeks to rally against the influence of corporate money in politics among a host of other issues. Nearly 80 people were arrested last weekend in a series of controversial incidents with the police using pepper spray on a female protester.

We can’t afford to give out even more tax breaks to the rich. It’s time to create jobs. Let’s put more money into the economy by raising the minimum wage and putting more money into the pockets of working people.\nThe Community Vigil will take place at 5:30, as local faith leaders will offer a prayer for a safe march. At 6:00pm, we will march down the designated parade route to the “public viewing area”, where members of the 99% will give their testimony.\nJoin us on Sunday, August 26th as we show the world that the RNC will be met by PEACEFUL opposition by the hard working men and women who make up the 99%, who make up the backbone of America.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/421297444586995/', 'Community Vigil and March on the “RNC Kick-Off Party” at the Trop', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3932-autosave', '', '', '2012-08-24 15:26:30', '2012-08-24 19:26:30', '', 3932, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/24/3932-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Congresswoman Baldwin is also a member of the the Congressional Progressive Caucus which now supports overturning the Citizens United Ruling. Coincidence? &#8211; Not likely but maybe more indirectly than directly.  As the fight continues, one can&#8217;t help but wonder, &#8220;How much cooperation will there be between the government and the occupation as things progress?&#8221;  This is what democracy looks like.</p>\n<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="https://occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/congressional-caucus-joins-fight-against-citizens-united/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pW1lwu0a8PY/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>\n<span style="text-align:center; display: block;"><a href="https://occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/congressional-caucus-joins-fight-against-citizens-united/"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZkA-rffPVaw/2.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/51/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com&#038;blog=34648553&%23038;post=51&%23038;subd=occupiedtampatribune&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />', 'Congressional Caucus Joins Fight Against Citizens United', 'By Anonymous Author The (CPC) Congressional Progressive Congress is the first congressional caucus to join the fight to reverse the Supreme Court decision for Citizens United.  Due to the Supreme Court&#8217;s Citizen&#8217;s United Ruling, corporations and unions can participate in &#8230; <a href="https://occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/congressional-caucus-joins-fight-against-citizens-united/">Continue reading <span>&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com&amp;blog=34648553&amp;post=51&amp;subd=occupiedtampatribune&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'congressional-caucus-joins-fight-against-citizens-united', '', '', '2012-04-29 20:40:45', '2012-04-30 00:40:45', '', 0, 'http://occupiedtampatribune.wordpress.com/?p=51', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Few realized that our country was not run by the people, but by the powerful, privileged, and wealthy. After the bailout of the banks and the slowly simmering political discontent that resulted, hundreds of people from around the country went to directly confront the Wall Street banksters that had ruined the economy and brought misery to millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>Occupy Wall Street has been the reawakening of political consciousness in the US. After 9/11, President Bush told us to shut the fuck up and keep shopping. We were told to not question the government and to not voice any political dissent. For so long, we had been good little serfs who blindly trusted the government, watched mainstream television, worked full time jobs where we were treated like slaves, and generally lost all sense of our own complicity in our oppression.</p>\n<p><span id="more-39"></span><br />\nWith Obama we thought there was hope, only to be let down. We had blindly trusted our electoral system, only to realize after electing him that <a title="campaign contributors" href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638">his largest campaign contributors</a> included Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, UBS, and Morgan Stanley. Normally there are limits to donations for presidential campaigns, but the Wall Street banks were able to launder the money through PACs and “employee contributions”. Obama appointed Rahm Emanuel as his White House Chief of Staff, even though there are allegations of impropriety during his tenure on Freddie Mac’s Board of Directors. The Obama administration has illegally refused <a title="FOIA Rahm Emmanuel" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-rahm-emanuel-profit-26-mar26,0,5682373.story">Freedom of Information Act</a> requests for Rahm Emanuel&#8217;s emails and Freddie Mac’s Board of Directors’ meeting minutes. As the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel has been instrumental in crushing any political dissent with <a title="sit down and shut up" href="http://occupiedchicagotribune.org/2012/01/occupiers-say-no-to-shut-up-and-sit-down-law/">“sit down and shut up”</a> ordinances in the leadup to NATO this May. He even used a <a title="occupy chicago mass arrest" href="http://rt.com/news/chicago-protest-arrest-police-971/">mass arrest</a> of Occupy Chicago members as a <a title="nato chicago mass arrest dry run" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/16/occupy-chicago-arrests-rahm-emanuels-dry-run">dry run</a> for the G8 and NATO protests.</p>\n<p>Obama also appointed Timothy Geithner as the Secretary of the Treasury. Geithner was previously head of the New York Federal Reserve which gave several large bailouts to Wall Street banks. There is still controversy over his involvement with AIG, because he colluded with AIG to <a title="geithner hide aig bailouts" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/08/ny-fed-aig-emails-spark-n_n_416503.html">hide its bailouts</a> from Congress and the American public. In addition, it has been recently revealed that corporately owned banks around the world were given <a title="16 trillion secret bailouts" href="http://www.unelected.org/audit-of-the-federal-reserve-reveals-16-trillion-in-secret-bailouts">secret bailouts</a> totally more than $16 trillion dollars from December 2007 to June 2010 without Congressional approval.</p>\n<p>The bailouts were primarily the result of Wall Street banks (many of the same ones that contributed to Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign) creating fraudulent mortgages. These fraudulent mortgages were put together into investment funds called Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) that were then sold to pension funds, credit unions, foreign governments, and other investors. The banks even <a title="banks bet against customers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/25/goldman-sachs-senator-carl-levin">bet against</a> their own products and sold these fraudulent investments to unsuspecting consumers. These investments were sold with <a title="AAA credit ratings fraud" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/160066/credit-rating-hoax">AAA credit ratings</a> even though the Wall Street banks knew that most of the these “subprime” borrowers would not be able to pay back their mortgages, thus making the investment funds completely worthless. A good analogy would be someone selling you gold only to find out later that you bought someone’s shit &#8211; it’s a very simple case of criminal fraud, conspiracy, and racketeering.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, most of the foreclosures happening in the US are illegal. The Wall Street banks that originated the mortgages contracted cheap mortgage processors to certify the paperwork. Many of these mortgage processors illegally used <a title="notary stamp fraud" href="http://www.nationalnotary.org/bulletin/bulletin_articles/hud_recommending_sanctions_against_bank_robo_notaries.html">notary stamps</a> (which is a felony in most states) to speed up these <a title="robo signing mills" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44365184/ns/business-real_estate/t/robo-signing-scandal-may-date-back-late-s/">robo-signing mills</a>. Then the Wall Street banks lost their fraudulent paperwork and illegally “recreated” the paperwork to foreclose on homeowners. Many lawyers are <a title="lawyers foreclosure paperwork fraud" href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/money/foreclosures/tsunami-of-foreclosure-complaints-swamps-fla-bar-2298138.html">knowingly submitting</a> this fraudulent paperwork to the foreclosure courts which is also a felony. In Florida, many of these judges are <a title="florida foreclosure retired judges" href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-01-15/business/os-foreclosure-mediation-20120115_1_foreclosure-cases-foreclosure-backlog-realtytrac">retired</a> and it is not clear that they even have the legal authority to work part time in specially established foreclosure courts with rocket dockets. Many of these foreclosure court proceedings are held in closed secret meetings although these are supposed to open to the public. In Duval County, Florida, it has been reported that <a title="duval foreclosure court armed guards" href="http://4closurefraud.org/2010/08/26/terrifying-armed-guards-now-blocking-access-to-foreclosure-courts/">armed guards</a> were stationed outside of these secret foreclosure courts to prevent the public from attending.</p>\n<p>Now the Obama administration is trying to pressure every state’s attorney general to sign a settlement with the major Wall Street banks. When the New York Attorney General refused to sign off on the 50 state mortgage fraud settlement, he was <a title="ny attorney general off bank settlement committee" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/business/schneiderman-removed-from-mortgage-inquiry-panel.html">taken off</a> of Obama’s foreclosure taskforce. In exchange for the bribe aka multi-state mortgage settlement, the state attorney generals agreed not to sue the banks even if they find more criminal activity was committed by the Wall Street banks. The benefits provided to homeowners such as principal reductions and reduced monthly payments was already supposed to be implemented under HAMP, but HAMP was a failure because the Wall Street banks <a title="banks illegally deny mortgage mods" href="http://www.propublica.org/article/when-denying-loan-mods-loan-servicers-often-blame-investors-wrongly">illegally denied</a> homeowners mortgage modifications.</p>\n<p>Deeds and titles to real estate are usually documented at county clerk of court offices. Every time a property changes ownership or a mortgage is sold a fee is supposed to be paid to the clerk of court. Wall Street banks worked together to create a company called MERS. The Wall Street banks registered mortgages as MERS being the owner of the mortgage. The Wall Street banks could then buy and sell mortgages to each other while avoiding property registration fees. There’s only one problem, MERS is probably <a title="mers probably illegal" href="http://foreclosuredefensenationwide.com/?p=400">illegal</a> and most mortgages in the US are registered as MERS owning the mortgage. In Hillsborough County, Florida, MERS has been able to defraud the county out of more than $1 billion dollars in property registration fees. Now consider, MERS is active in thousands of counties around the United States. MERS is literally defrauding local governments out of trillions of dollars every year. In addition, MERS was supposed to keep the property title and deed together at all times, otherwise these documents are no longer <a title="mers docs invalid " href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdoc%2F61543981%2FMERS-The-Unreported-Effects-of-Lost-Chain-of-Title-on-Real-Property-Owners-and-Their-Neighbors&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuu06jN_n4iJ7c3K6swb5f0ywHfw">valid</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for people paying their mortgages, MERS often <a title="mers loses docs" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130570666">loses</a> all kinds of paperwork. MERS also routinely splits the deed and title, thus making them both invalid documents. When lawyers submit affidavits of lost title, it really means “Oops, we lost all of your paperwork” or the bank’s lawyers <a title="lawyers submit fake docs" href="http://floridaforeclosurefraud.com/2011/03/how-this-83-fountain-pen-helped-save-a-family-home-from-foreclosure/">submit fake documents</a>. Since the chain of title is broken on many MERS mortgages, lots of real estate in the US literally does not have a legal owner. And how would you ever re-establish a chain of title and get a legal owner? &#8230;In most states, you cannot and there is no process to recreate a property title. The only way many people could ever legally own their homes is if they <a title="homeowner sues Mers" href="http://dailybail.com/home/man-beats-bank-and-creates-mortgage-banking-mers-bomb-lost-p.html">sue MERS</a> and get the property title awarded to them in punitive damages. In many states, there is also something called adverse possession which is another way to gain a title to abandoned property.</p>\n<p>Considering all the criminal conspiracy and lawbreaking going on at the Wall Street banks, you would assume that the government would be prosecuting these criminals. Well, you would be wrong. Wall Street banks are trying to <a title="push through foreclosure laws" href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/money/foreclosures/bill-to-streamline-foreclosures-clears-key-state-senate-2188489.html">quickly push through laws</a> in state legislatures to make it almost impossible for people to stop illegal foreclosures on their homes and limit their right to sue the banks for fraud.</p>\n<p>These Wall Street banks are the real criminals who go so far as to hire <a title="banksters hire private foreclosure contractors" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/video/bank-breaks-into-occupied-home-11825073">private contractors</a> to break into people’s homes. Jewelry, large screen TVs, laptops, and other expensive items mysteriously disappear after the bank contractors criminally break and enter into victims homes that have NOT been in foreclosure. They even go so far as to kidnap the <a title="bank steal pets" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704655004575113872190094934.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_5">victims’ pets</a> or <a title="foreclosure cremated ashes stolen" href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/home_garden/114201/bank_of_america_breaks_in">relative’s cremated ashes</a>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, America is a seriously fucked up country. The government passes terrible laws and cannot even enforce the laws it has on the books. Instead of putting Wall Street banksters in jail, the government happily goes along enforcing illegal foreclosures and uses the police to beat the shit out of anyone who <a title="police brutality scott olsen" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/27/BAD61LN3LM.DTL">protests</a> the banksters’ criminal activities.</p>\n<p>From the winter of our discontent comes the spring to action, the summer of strikes, and the fall of a corrupt system.

Keeping things short and to the point helps maintain attention especially when applied to a large group.

People listened to each other, the facilitation was fluid and effective and no one blocked decisions to disrupt the flow of the meeting.</li>\n<li>participation by many&#8230;the passion tends to be infectious</li>\n<li>Active stack-taking and facilitating (as long as the facilitator is active in facilitating, not answering questions or participating without stack) can make a meeting seem productivNew people talking energizes the whole meeting</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>When, in the course of your involvement with the group, have you felt particularly empowered?</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>everyone should be able to feel empowered within this movement. All it takes is presenting your ideas in a way to win people over to them,</li>\n<li>whenever there was a need that I had experience or knowledge in.</li>\n<li>When value is attributed to what I have to share.</li>\n<li>When I was asked to facilitatEspecially so when I started and completed a project with the support from many in the group.  Hosting events and workshops.</li>\n<li>It is nice to see and hear affirmations from the group. But I am a person of considerable privilage. I benefit greatly by staying quiet and waiting my turn.</li>\n<li>By being able to offer campers the opportunity to bathe and relax in my apartment which was close by.</li>\n<li>when i did an oppression workshop and people were actually interested; the first day during the GA</li>\n<li>While I did feel empowered with the solidarity at GA, working groups were the most empowering to me. Discussion, somewhat of the ideas, but mostly of how to bring the ideas to action in our daily lives, empowered me in a lasting way.</li>\n<li>I felt empowered the minute I walked into the first organization meeting, knowing that I was sitting in a room of free thinking individuals, some I had never met, and yet we had so much in common already. I feel as though I can actually make a difference, or at least help when it comes to fixing the broken nation and connecting with others to discuss topics that aren&#8217;t covered by the media but are far more important than what senator is cheating on his/her spouse.</li>\n<li>As i said above, i find the whole thing empowering. I really loved the marches that we did! I only wish that the &#8220;global day of action&#8221; march was larger. All the conversations i have had at the occupy are important&#8230; Before this, i wanted social change but i idnt know what to do. Now i feel like i have people who &#8220;get me&#8221; and i feel like we can make a difference.</li>\n<li>attending the GAs and hearing others speak w.respecT</li>\n<li>I felt empowered when I was the stack-taker; I felt empowered in GA reflection sessions after the GA and was told about problems with my stack-taking; I feel empowered in private conversations listening to other thinking about our organization and process.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>In what ways has your involvement with the group enhanced your life personally?</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>I feel hopeful again, I realize I let go of a lot of things I did when i was younger simply because after years and years it starts to feel pointless. Now I can feel like if I shop locally or skip Christmas or use cash or whatever, others are doing so as well and it could add up to something that matters.</li>\n<li>reinvigorated revolutionary spirit, new connections and more optimistic view of things</li>\n<li>I have branched out into other movements.  There is so much to do, but Occupy has been the trigger allowing me to voice my opinion.</li>\n<li>I am now a member of EmpathySurplus.  Wow!   Is it wonderful!</li>\n<li>Made lots of very good friends.  Spent quality time with existing friends.  Got back in touch with long lost friends.  Made priceless romantic connections <img src=''https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </li>\n<li>The Occupy movement meets a core need I have to do some kind of direct action against this world domination system.</li>\n<li>It brought me back to listening to my own heart and thoughts as well as learning new things. I also am able to share what I know from my experiences in the anti-war demonstrations of my youth.</li>\n<li>i&#8217;ve made many new friends; when the encampment was going on i knew i had a place to go where i could talk to people, instead of being isolated</li>\n<li>My job is over this month. While I&#8217;m still not sure what I&#8217;m doing afterwards, Occupy has helped encourage me about working with community gardens next year. The focus on personal responsibility and community self-sufficiency makes me feel that my efforts will not be ignored and that there will be others working alongside me. It has encouraged me to and continues to provide opportunity to use my education to the benefit of the group (a general term, not specifically Occupy) outside the monetary system.</li>\n<li>I have always had passion towards community-growth especially in Toledo along with politics and wanting to bring crucial information to the maintstream. With that being said, I was also on the verge of giving up hope that this would ever truly be possible. I believe it is, and I believe we&#8217;ll see it sooner than many might think at that.</li>\n<li>I am ashamed to say that i have been pacified by my belongings. I figured that i have a home, we have food, we have &#8220;entertainment&#8221;&#8230;things that keep us zombifie Alot of times politics and stuff like that confuses me so i dont pay attention&#8230;i figure as long as i have a roof, a job, and can feed my ki.. Whatever. I saw a livestream of OWS, and it was getting violent. The one cop said that his &#8221; nightstick was going to get a workout&#8221;. I was appalle It got my attention.i started listening to what those people were saying and reading things about the occupations. I saw that we were starting an occupation in Toledo, so i went down there to check it out. I started talking to people and i started to realize that I Am pissed off too!</li>\n<li>continued my revolutionary spirit</li>\n<li>I&#8217;ve met a lot of great people that I didn&#8217;t even know lived in Toledo!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>In what ways has your involvement with the group contributed to your relationships and conversations OUTSIDE the group?</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>better conversations outside of the occupy, more surveys i get to fill out</li>\n<li>I am practicing my long lost skills of reframinRead George Laikoff.</li>\n<li>Thinking Points.</li>\n<li>Have gotten a chance to talk about issues with others.  Many friends who could not make it personally showed a great deal of support.</li>\n<li>It is a bit of a social risk to claim my place within the occupy movement at work and among my peers. Mostly the response has been positive. But even when it has not been positive, the Occupy Movement has shown itself to be superior to just voting and going on one day parades.</li>\n<li>I have had many conversations about the movement and learned from those that both approve and disapprovI also was able to teach others about the Occupy Movement and saw some light up with excitement.</li>\n<li>family and folks at work ask me about OT.  i try to dodge the issue alot, though, because i hate defending my views sometimes.</li>\n<li>The movement is a popular topic of discussion, and it has been a positive discussion even if it got off to a rocky start with some neo-conservative acquaintances. The calls for action discussed at the GA resonate with almost everyone I&#8217;ve talked to. The movement has helped spread a feeling of empowerment beyond itself.</li>\n<li>My focus has shifted to surround myself with intelligent free thinkers who would rather sit around and discuss current events as opposed to socializing and ignoring the shit around us. I have gained self-respect especially through my education (both college and self).</li>\n<li>Bah! Thanksgiving was awkward because my grandma saw me on tv at an occupation event ( i believe it was the global day of action march) anyways, she didnt speak a word to my husband or our daughter! My brother in law said she is terrified of the movement and cant believe we are a part of it! I have alot of friends at work that ask me about occupy. I love to explain to people whats going on and watch their faces change as they think about their own life!</li>\n<li>tell a few others especially my closest friend</li>\n<li>Talking Occupy with people I just met leads me to talking about politics much earlier in the timeline of the conversation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Think of the characteristics about yourself that differentiate you from everyone else. How do these make you special or important in the group?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>mending relationships, opening dialog and resolving conflicts are my specialty</li>\n<li>Problem-solving matters of infrastructur Engaging people with a friendly, loving attitude to help them see me as a savvy elder.</li>\n<li>by being a vocal voice for an underrepresented oppressed class.  It helps to give the group broader appeal and insurance that the safer space policy will be uphel</li>\n<li>I have been studying politics and economics for about ten years. And I stay up to date by reading from progressive websites every day. I think one area where I was able to use my gifts was by making informed arguments on our facebook page in support of the Occupy Movement. I think this was a helpful apology and encouragment for our group.</li>\n<li>I am one of the elders and act as a mother figure to somI have sung at the campsite and supported those who were having problems relating to others.</li>\n<li>i have a great &#8216;toolbelt&#8217; with being a social worker, so i have used those &#8216;tools&#8217; at many different times within the group</li>\n<li>My dedication to a cause is kind of rare and also can result in being hyper-focused or working 12hr days. I enjoy being relentless, and this movement is a good constructive outlet for that. People notice and appreciate that intensity when I talk with them about the cause.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="13">\n<li>my ability to empathize along with the fact that I am constantly focusing on alternative perspectives different from that of my own, which allows me to grow and learn while maintaining a neutral outlook when working with others.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m a migrant in the worl Have a international view of what&#8217;s happening to this country.</li>\n<li>&#8220;can add from experience. i listen and am patient&#8221;</li>\n<li>I know a lot of people in local politics, service agencies, and advocacy groups.  I want to talk about process and organization structure and how to create an architecture for inclusive decision-makinThough maybe that doesn&#8217;t make me different here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What gives life to the occupy movement? Nationally or locally.</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>I think the main thing that needs to be maintained is hope. If individual people continue to believe they can create change, it will happen.</li>\n<li>people</li>\n<li>The enthusiasm of youth combined with the awakening of the 99%.</li>\n<li>A general dissatisfaction with the current political and economic conditions.  An interest in active rebellion/revolution for others.</li>\n<li>The occupy movement, by the act of sustaining the protest in a stable location, brought many of us individual activists together. We saw we were not alone. We discovered that we like each other. We see the brilliance in each other. We have become a community of resistance.</li>\n<li>The willingness of Occupiers to listen and shar</li>\n<li>Their intelligence and motivations to bring about the changes that will help our society survive and grow.</li>\n<li>The international flowering of concern for others in different situations in different locations.</li>\n<li>The closeness of Occupiers that allows individuals to be a part of a greater wholTo find a family outside of genetics.</li>\n<li>the community</li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t know; to me this is kind of like asking how life originate</li>\n<li>breaking barriers to get in touch with everyone by helping them understand how the movement relates to them.</li>\n<li>The crisis of the global economy. More specifi.. the downfall of the capitalism system.</li>\n<li>I think that meeting like minded people who are going through similar things and getting a chance to discuss these things gets people fired up. Up until this point many of us were content to hide in our houses and be dumbed down by our tv. We have been content to hide in the house and communicate via text messages and facebook. The movemnt has gained a following thanks to the internet.. But i really believe it is because it forced us to come outside and see what is happening. We have lost our ability to communicate face to face with each other.. With the movement&#8230; People are waking up, coming out of there houses, talking face to face with other people&#8230; Its beautiful!</li>\n<li>recognition by more and more that there must be real change and to adopt and embrace real action</li>\n<li>The problems with corporate power.  Hope.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>When have you, or when would you, feel especially motivated to start, or complete a project?</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>when theres a deadline or an urgent need or it has something to do with ninjas</li>\n<li>I am currently putting together sayings, slogans&#8230;. to display on the road frontage of my farm which will engage people in reframing vague ideas.</li>\n<li>I am focusing on cleaning up politics and supporting universal health car</li>\n<li>When I felt it important to do so.  If I could tell the group needed something, like education in certain areas.  Or if actions were needed to be taken, as in response to somethin</li>\n<li>I am motivated by the group synergy.</li>\n<li>I have felt most motivated when I feel that I am using my time efficiently to accomplish a task that benefits others or myself, often in a way that cannot be quantitatively measure I am now feeling motivated by the impending collapse of the global economy that will necessitate an active, loving restructuring of civilization that Occupy should be ready to facilitate.</li>\n<li>when my sanity depends on it or when i need to regain focus and confidence in my abilities and knowledge.</li>\n<li>everyday really <img src=''https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </li>\n<li>I would feel motivated to start a project when I feel like I have the time to start a project.  I feel motivated to help complete a project when somebody else is doing exciting work, seeking new ways for positive communication and decision-making.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why do you think the media remains fascinated with the occupy movement?</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>I think a lot of this is reflected through the lens of the 60s. both for people who remember it firsthand and those who have only read about it in history. The media wants another large scale movement to focus on. Also the battles to maintain camps have actually increased media interest. People being pepper sprayed or tear gassed adds a surreal note to a story that wouldnt have mattered much after a short while, basically a bunch of people freezing in tents.</li>\n<li>hey see its resonance and potential power and want to harness or attack  it for ratings, credibility, money and use it in anyway they can.</li>\n<li>They know it is real and not going away.  The Arab Spring woke everybody up.</li>\n<li>Because of it&#8217;s fluidity, it&#8217;s unorthodox nature, broad appeal, unpredictable.</li>\n<li>It is new. It is different. It is brining creativity into direct action. Occupy has the power that comes from speaking plain truth. Occupy pointed the finger at the bad guys on Wall Street that own Washington, rather than getting lost in the DC political swamp.</li>\n<li>Because this is a movement that is not ruled by individuals but is run by consensus of all involve  This is a new  (to the media) form of organizational cooperation.  Not the usual pyramid but a Horizontal form.</li>\n<li>america is not used to something like this.  the occupy movement has many anarchist principals and the media in the US isn&#8217;t used to it.</li>\n<li>They cannot reasonably ignore the movement now that its ideas are in the hearts and minds of many Americans. The media can only favor the establishment by obscuring the message and distracting from it.</li>\n<li>The media remains fascinated because they aren&#8217;t the popular topic within the movement. most people pay attention to the media and use it to guide in decision making, the movement may pay some attention mainly to gain insight and understand what alternative stories and problems our country is actually plagued with.</li>\n<li>Because it is now an international movement.</li>\n<li>Because we are legion. Because they are frightene Because they know that we are no longer content to be sheep&#8230;.. Plus i am sure it is good ratings. <img src=''https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> . Then the other turn of the coin, some of them try to discredit our movement at every turn, they try to continue to separate us by causing fear. The media stirs the pot and the classes separate themselves&#8230;therefore people who are not part of the 1%&#8230; who are in fact part of the 99%&#8230; are angry at those of us who stand up and say no&#8230;</li>\n<li>they are fascibated because they do not know what to really report</li>\n<li>It fits into mainstream media narratives, but also provides lots and lots of issues for blogs and grassroots media to explore.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Describe our ideal future. In the short term (say, 2011).</h3>\n<ol start="1">\n<li>  for Toledo or nationally? Getting people into vacant houses is a good step to start with. There needs to be continuing support by the general public for whatever actions come next. After a point camping in parks or protests and march lose interest.

An influx of police vehicles soon followed. The well-recognized white Crown Victorias then joined in to create an unambiguous parade of police power. Police involved were both plain-clothed and uniformed.\r\n\r\nAs the night progressed, up to 20 police officers parked their cars within sight of Voice of Freedom Park and proceeded to walk up and down the public sidewalks. 5 police officers then began circling the Occupy Tampa camp in an authoritative and intimidating manner. Two of these police officers entered the park, were informed that the park was private and were asked to leave. Other officers began searching private property throughout the West Tampa area without permission of the property owners, without warrants, and without probable cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers walked through the park a second, and even third time without permission, conducting multiple searches in the process, they clearly violated the Constitution''s Fourth Amendment, disrespecting the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The police officers did not have probable cause or display a warrant of any type to enter Voice of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, within full view of the camp, the police pulled over passing vehicles without any justification, searching nearly every vehicle that entered the area. In complete disregard for public safety, the officers shined their flashlights into the windshields of oncoming traffic, presumably blinding drivers. Unwilling to be subjected to illegal pullovers and searches themselves, the Occupiers present did not feel free to leave the neighborhood and stayed to witness the entire operation.\r\n\r\nIf this type of illegal behavior from the police continues, the police department and the city of Tampa can expect internal affairs complaints, criminal charges, and civil lawsuits.\r\n\r\nPeople clearly upset at this blatant misuse of city resources include West Tampa business owners and workers who lost patrons due to these intimidation tactics. Occupy Tampa stands in solidarity with the residents and businesses of West Tampa against this police intimidation and harassment.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa would like to invite the news media to speak with the members of Occupy Tampa who witnessed these events. We will hold a press conference on Monday at 5pm. \r\n\r\nVictims, witnesses, and anyone with footage of these events, please feel free to contact tampacommunity@hushmail.com or call (646) 470-1639 and leave a message. \r\n\r\nPress contact:\r\nmedia@occupytampa.org\r\n\r\nZoe Alif:\r\nzoealif@gmail.com\r\n\r\nTim Grantham:\r\ntimothy.p.grantham@gmail.com\r\n', 'Statement on the Police Misconduct in West Tampa on the Evening of 8/17/2012', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3755-revision-5', '', '', '2012-08-19 21:07:16', '2012-08-20 01:07:16', '', 3755, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/19/3755-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

On the local front, corporate energy giants and Republican politicians have pushed to open Florida’s coast to off-shore drilling for oil and gas, permitted thousands of megawatts of new fossil fuel power plants in the state, and collaborated on plans to <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2011/20110419periana.html" target="_blank">fuse the biotech industry with energy giants</a>. On the national agenda, Republican politicians and lobbyists are promising industry heads support for tar sands exploration, gas fracking, coal mining and new nukes.\n\nMost groups planning to protest the Republican National Convention next week have focused on the wealth gap and the economy in general. But the history of failed civilizations show us that economic crises begin and end with ecological crisis.\n\nOur environmental message of protecting the planet from industrial pillage is needed here and now, more than ever.\n\nAll of us working on issues of pollution, water, development, energy, climate, greed, and the corruption that ties it all together, should be out in the streets of Tampa and St. Pete next week.

(3) Our liaison with Fire Dog Lake, Sonja Ebron, continues to work with Occupy Tampa by securing items such as sunscreen, bug spray, bandanas, portable water containers, sleeping bags and mats, UV protective shirts a\r\nnd other useful items.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa has formed a Regional General Assembly to coordinate Occupy groups throughout the bay area, including: Occupy Lakeland, Occupy St. Petersburg, Occupy Bradenton, Occupy USF, Occupy New Port Richey, and Occupy Sarasota. We have tried to plan as much as possible ahead of time, but we want to leave space open to spontaneously produce additional actions by harnessing the number of people that arrive.\r\n\r\nFood not Bombs has called a World Gathering and plans to run feeding operations throughout the duration of the RNC. A week before the Republican National Convention, chapters of Food Not Bombs from every corner of the globe will convene in order to prepare to feed the thousands of protesters flooding into the city. FNB will serve brunch everyday at 10 am, at Voice of Freedom Park, and will also serve dinner before the General Assemblies. We will offer warm-ups at 9 am, including yoga & other light exercises.\r\n\r\nWe invite everyone to come and take advantage of the preparations we have made, to help ensure that all occupiers and other supporting groups can use this moment of national attention to confront the political status-quo.\r\n\r\nWe currently occupy a privately-owned, publicly accessible park (fittingly named "Voice of Freedom). The owner has donated the space for use by the Occupy Movement.Facilities include: running water, two port-a-potties, parking, Internet access, and electricity.\r\n\r\nOur address is 2101 W. Main St. Tampa, Fl.

I asked her: Given that we have no real way to measure our progress (except perhaps media attention), how do we deal with the resulting disenchantment? After all, <a href="http://mindslikeknives.blogspot.com/2012/04/open-letter-to-occupy-tampa-its-members.html">the revolution won''t run like a movie</a>. And she replied: Regardless of whether or not we make progress, the fact remains that we have an a priori duty to /do something./ The state of affairs, the income gap, the banksters behavior and immunity, and everything else, makes it a duty to do something. If someone has a better idea, or more organizing experience, or something, we welcome their help.\r\n\r\nAlso, in several discussions and at a recent GA, the point came up that we ought to channel the future of OT into the housing issue. (1) Hillsborough has one of the highest, if not the highest, foreclosure rates in the country, (2) The law saying that stadiums built with public funding must house the homeless has gone ignored, (3) They want to demolish the public housing at North Boulevard Homes, and our attempts to empower the community against this played a part in motivating the petition, (4) People have characterized OT as a homeless camp, which has all kinds of classist and dehumanizing implications, but this does not represent the problem, it represents the symptom of a greater problem: (homelessness).</blockquote>\r\n****\r\n\r\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re: regarding the lack of focus criticism\r\n<strong>From:</strong> Susie Shannon\r\n<strong>To:</strong> Sue Carlton - Tampa Bay Times, Tristan Lear\r\n<strong>CC:</strong> Janelle Irwin - WMNF, Kathleen Flynn - Tampa Bay Times, Kathy Steele - Tampa Tribune, Justin George - Tampa Bay Times\r\n<blockquote>Indeed, it is difficult with assaults on working class people coming from all sides to "focus" on any one issue. From corporate practices (speculation, derivatives and insider trading, maximizing bottom lines over all other considerations, etc.) to legislation that legalizes those practices and privatizes commonly held properties and public services, to usurious lending practices, illegal foreclosures, loss of jobs, lack of access to affordable health care, increasingly expensive education, destruction of unions, deteriorating civil rights, crumbling infrastructure, destruction of wildlife habitat, poisoning of natural resources, loss of potable water, dangerous food processing practices, lack of access to the judiciary, loss of voting rights and on and on, the issues are so huge and widespread as to be crippling to any concerned citizen. If Occupy appears to lack focus it''s because so many of us want to address ALL of these issues. If we don''t have the numbers we''d like, it''s because so many of us are so exhausted from merely trying to survive that we are unable to put time or energy into defending ourselves given the many fronts on we are being accosted.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances, and coupled with our reliance on increasingly sanitized news, it is remarkable that any of us have fight or hope left in us. That Occupy continues to fight is a testament to the absolute necessity of addressing these issues before we no longer have a planet or a citizenry to protect. Despite the enormity if not the impossibility of the task ahead, we have no choice but to labor on. I for one could not live with myself if I reneged on my most human responsibility to my community and my planet. It is difficult to be "effective" when fighting a tornado, but that doesn''t mean one should sit back and allow oneself to be swallowed without a fight.</blockquote>\r\nSusie Shannon', 'Regarding the Criticism that We Lack Focus', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'regarding-the-criticism-that-we-lack-focus-2', '', '', '2012-07-14 16:10:35', '2012-07-14 20:10:35', '', 0, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/?p=2859', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I have attached a copy of our Charrette week flier and invitation. The Homeless Coalition and the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) have teamed up and are working on a 10-year plan to end homelessness in our Community. The Charrette week is an important step in that process, so, as a member of the Steering Committee, I wanted to invite you and other Occupy Tampa members to participate. On the flier, you will see the issue areas that we will be focused on addressing.\r\n \r\nAlso, please visit the Homeless Coalition website - www.homelessofhc.org - to find more ways to get involved and participate. Below is a link to the Homeless Coalition Facebook Page, which has a link to the HC/CSH 10-Year Plan Community Survey. We would love your input and thoughts on this plan. Please feel free to share this information with others who wish to participate as well.\r\n \r\nwww.facebook.com/HomelessofHC\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nLisa\r\n \r\nLisa J.

However within our own backyard, the Tampa Police killed 16-year-old Javon Neal. Numerous eyewitness accounts contradict the official narrative. Many in the community have raised questions about the incident and demand transparency, and above all, justice.\n\nOn this Saturday, July 28th, residents and activists will host an action outside of the District 3 Police Station from 10 AM until Noon. We call upon the members of Occupy Tampa to show their support. We call for the people to stand in solidarity with West Tampa and all those subject to police repression both in the streets of Tampa and worldwide.\n\nFrom WMNF:\n\nAn African-American teenage boy was shot and killed by two Tampa Police officers Sunday night in Tampa Heights. Police reports say sixteen-year-old Javon Neal was armed with a gun, but some witnesses are disputing that claim. Today some activists called on the community to demand justice for the slain boy. Life Malcolm said residents of predominantly black communities should think twice before calling the police for help.\n\n“Because their way of solving our problems is leaving one of our children dead. That’s what they do every time they come into our community. So, you’re absolutely right, they say they responded to a call but right now we’re here educating our people to stop talking to the police, stop calling the police because every time they come to our neighborhood we lose something, either our property, our freedom, or in last night’s case, our life.”\n\nMalcolm, who is a member of the Black People’s Advancement and Defense Organization, led a group of five activists in a heated speech about just how much trouble increased police presence is in low-income areas during a protest in front of the front of Tampa Police’s District Three office.\n\nHe said there isn’t anything that can be done to help Javon Neal, the teenager who was shot by police. Instead Malcolm said it’s a wake up call to the black community that something needs to change.\n\n“Out with police occupation and in with economic development, that’s what we want. No police. Economic Development. So that’s a specific concern because if the police were not always in our neighborhood – we live like they did in Nazi Germany. We have police around us all the time. If you look like you have a wallet in your hand or a cell phone in your hand you might get shot. If you turn around too fast, you might get shot. If you don’t turn around fast enough, you might get shot. If you stay in the car, you might get shot. So, we want the end of police occupation and we want to see some economic development.”\n\nThe fatal shooting occurred after a citizen called the Tampa Police Department to report gunfire. According to Laura McElroy, spokesperson for the department, it was the fourth time police responded to the Central Court Apartments in Tampa Heights that day. McElroy said police were investigating a possible shooting and when they arrived at the apartment complex, officers found Javon Neal, who fit the description of the suspect from the previous incident. She said the officers gave orders for him to stop, but he continued to flee. McElroy said according to police reports, Neal removed a pistol-grip shotgun from his pants and pointed it at the officers. That’s when they fired.\n\n“The bottom line is this is a very dangerous assault-style weapon. It absolutely has no business being in the hands of a teenager. And that really is the crux of the tragedy of this shooting, that a teenager was armed with such a menacing assault-style rifle. Not only was he armed with it, but he pointed it at two police officers who, if they had not fired, would probably not be with us today.”\n\nBut witnesses at the scene don’t remember it that way. Kemon Ford, Neal’s 12-year-old brother witnessed the shooting. He said everything happened too fast, but he never saw a gun.\n\n“So then they got upstairs and then he looked backed and saw them and then they was doing at him like this with the gun then he put his hands up. Then they got up there and then they had shot him.”\n\nHorrett Traban is one of Neal’s closest friends. He watched the horror unfold as police arrived and said their accounts of the incident just don’t match up.\n\n“He was standing in the parking lot with me and my family because somebody else had shot a pistol right down the street. So, he was like ‘let me get in the house before they go…’ But I ain’t think he was going to go in the house, so I’m talking to my cousin. When I turn around, when they say ‘there go the police’, I’m looking around and he gone. He already gone. And if he was already gone he could have made it into the house if he was running.”\n\nSome witnesses said they saw Neal place his hands over his head, but other witnesses have said that was someone else. Others questioned why the gun was found on the ground and not on the third floor where Neal was shot. Tampa Police’s McElroy said that just proves that Neal pointed the gun at officers because he would have had to have been holding the gun above the four-foot tall guard rail. Michele Williams, a member of the New Black Panther Party, an activist group, said there is a way to clear up the inconsistencies.\n\n“In the apartment complex there are two video cameras in every stairwell. So it caught everything that transpired in Central Court Apartments last night and that’s what I’m asking. I’m asking that they do something about this and I’m asking that they reveal that tape to us.”\n\nMcElroy, spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department said she would not release that evidence but it has been turned over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as part of the ongoing investigation.\n\n“We have a sixteen year old who has been killed so this is a very serious investigation and that, all that video if there is any that actually captures the shooting or any portion of it would be part of that. So, it’s going to be a very thorough investigation. I can’t say exactly how long it will take.”\n\nPolice said the two officers involved were Shannon Murphy and Gregory Pryor. Both have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation which police say is standard procedure. Michele Williams from the New Black Panther Party wants justice for Javon Neal’s shooting not just because she thinks officers were wrong about him, but because of how they handled it afterward.\n\n“I physically see white police officers high-fiving one another. That disturbed me. It’s already surfacing on YouTube and Facebook right now that the police were high-fiving one another – we got him.”\n\nJavon Neal’s mother, Kethessa Fordoms, lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred. She said she had asked Neal to stay inside because there had been gunshots earlier in the day, but she eventually let her guard down. Fordoms choked back tears as she described her son as just a boy. According to her, he wasn’t running from police officers, he was playing a game with some friends.\n\n“He had never been in trouble, he never started trouble. He mainly stayed to his self. And he was playing with someone inside the complex and the whole time the cops thought that he was running from them and that wasn’t the case. He was playing and they just gunned my son down for no reason.”\n\nFollowing the small protest in front of Tampa Police’s district three office, about 40 people gathered at the Central Court Apartments for another demonstration. At one point, two individuals began arguing about the incident. One of the unidentified individuals was accusing the other of being the person who actually had a gun and blamed him for Javon Neal’s shooting. No one would comment on the argument.\n\nWhen: 10AM-Noon.\n\nWhere: District 3 Police Station, 3808 North 22nd Street, Tampa, FL  33610\n\n\n****\n\nAfter the demonstration, remember to attend the Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly @ South Straub Park in Saint Petersburg!\n\n****\n\nAfter the demonstration, remember to attend the Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly @ South Straub Park in Saint Petersburg!\n\n<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/nvda-action-javon-neal/?instance_id=423630">Occupytampa.org event page</a>\n\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/112208978924250/">Facebook event page</a>\n', 'Demand transparency from the Tampa Police!

We call upon the members of Occupy Tampa to show their support. We call for the people to stand in solidarity with West Tampa and all those subject to police repression both in the streets of Tampa and worldwide.\r\n\r\nFrom WMNF:\r\n\r\nAn African-American teenage boy was shot and killed by two Tampa Police officers Sunday night in Tampa Heights. Police reports say sixteen-year-old Javon Neal was armed with a gun, but some witnesses are disputing that claim. Today some activists called on the community to demand justice for the slain boy. Life Malcolm said residents of predominantly black communities should think twice before calling the police for help.\r\n\r\n“Because their way of solving our problems is leaving one of our children dead. That’s what they do every time they come into our community. So, you’re absolutely right, they say they responded to a call but right now we’re here educating our people to stop talking to the police, stop calling the police because every time they come to our neighborhood we lose something, either our property, our freedom, or in last night’s case, our life.”\r\n\r\nMalcolm, who is a member of the Black People’s Advancement and Defense Organization, led a group of five activists in a heated speech about just how much trouble increased police presence is in low-income areas during a protest in front of the front of Tampa Police’s District Three office.\r\n\r\nHe said there isn’t anything that can be done to help Javon Neal, the teenager who was shot by police. Instead Malcolm said it’s a wake up call to the black community that something needs to change.\r\n\r\n“Out with police occupation and in with economic development, that’s what we want. No police. Economic Development. So that’s a specific concern because if the police were not always in our neighborhood – we live like they did in Nazi Germany. We have police around us all the time. If you look like you have a wallet in your hand or a cell phone in your hand you might get shot. If you turn around too fast, you might get shot. If you don’t turn around fast enough, you might get shot. If you stay in the car, you might get shot. So, we want the end of police occupation and we want to see some economic development.”\r\n\r\nThe fatal shooting occurred after a citizen called the Tampa Police Department to report gunfire. According to Laura McElroy, spokesperson for the department, it was the fourth time police responded to the Central Court Apartments in Tampa Heights that day. McElroy said police were investigating a possible shooting and when they arrived at the apartment complex, officers found Javon Neal, who fit the description of the suspect from the previous incident. She said the officers gave orders for him to stop, but he continued to flee. McElroy said according to police reports, Neal removed a pistol-grip shotgun from his pants and pointed it at the officers. That’s when they fired.\r\n\r\n“The bottom line is this is a very dangerous assault-style weapon. It absolutely has no business being in the hands of a teenager. And that really is the crux of the tragedy of this shooting, that a teenager was armed with such a menacing assault-style rifle. Not only was he armed with it, but he pointed it at two police officers who, if they had not fired, would probably not be with us today.”\r\n\r\nBut witnesses at the scene don’t remember it that way. Kemon Ford, Neal’s 12-year-old brother witnessed the shooting. He said everything happened too fast, but he never saw a gun.\r\n\r\n“So then they got upstairs and then he looked backed and saw them and then they was doing at him like this with the gun then he put his hands up. Then they got up there and then they had shot him.”\r\n\r\nHorrett Traban is one of Neal’s closest friends. He watched the horror unfold as police arrived and said their accounts of the incident just don’t match up.\r\n\r\n“He was standing in the parking lot with me and my family because somebody else had shot a pistol right down the street. So, he was like ‘let me get in the house before they go…’ But I ain’t think he was going to go in the house, so I’m talking to my cousin. When I turn around, when they say ‘there go the police’, I’m looking around and he gone. He already gone. And if he was already gone he could have made it into the house if he was running.”\r\n\r\nSome witnesses said they saw Neal place his hands over his head, but other witnesses have said that was someone else. Others questioned why the gun was found on the ground and not on the third floor where Neal was shot. Tampa Police’s McElroy said that just proves that Neal pointed the gun at officers because he would have had to have been holding the gun above the four-foot tall guard rail. Michele Williams, a member of the New Black Panther Party, an activist group, said there is a way to clear up the inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n“In the apartment complex there are two video cameras in every stairwell. So it caught everything that transpired in Central Court Apartments last night and that’s what I’m asking. I’m asking that they do something about this and I’m asking that they reveal that tape to us.”\r\n\r\nMcElroy, spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department said she would not release that evidence but it has been turned over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as part of the ongoing investigation.\r\n\r\n“We have a sixteen year old who has been killed so this is a very serious investigation and that, all that video if there is any that actually captures the shooting or any portion of it would be part of that. So, it’s going to be a very thorough investigation. I can’t say exactly how long it will take.”\r\n\r\nPolice said the two officers involved were Shannon Murphy and Gregory Pryor. Both have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation which police say is standard procedure. Michele Williams from the New Black Panther Party wants justice for Javon Neal’s shooting not just because she thinks officers were wrong about him, but because of how they handled it afterward.\r\n\r\n“I physically see white police officers high-fiving one another. That disturbed me. It’s already surfacing on YouTube and Facebook right now that the police were high-fiving one another – we got him.”\r\n\r\nJavon Neal’s mother, Kethessa Fordoms, lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred. She said she had asked Neal to stay inside because there had been gunshots earlier in the day, but she eventually let her guard down. Fordoms choked back tears as she described her son as just a boy. According to her, he wasn’t running from police officers, he was playing a game with some friends.\r\n\r\n“He had never been in trouble, he never started trouble. He mainly stayed to his self. And he was playing with someone inside the complex and the whole time the cops thought that he was running from them and that wasn’t the case. He was playing and they just gunned my son down for no reason.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the small protest in front of Tampa Police’s district three office, about 40 people gathered at the Central Court Apartments for another demonstration. At one point, two individuals began arguing about the incident. One of the unidentified individuals was accusing the other of being the person who actually had a gun and blamed him for Javon Neal’s shooting.

At one point, two individuals began arguing about the incident. One of the unidentified individuals was accusing the other of being the person who actually had a gun and blamed him for Javon Neal’s shooting. No one would comment on the argument.\n\n****\n\nAfter the demonstration, remember to attend the Tampa Bay Regional General Assembly @ South Straub Park in Saint Petersburg!\n\nTime: Saturday July 28th at 10:00 AM\nLocation: District 3 Police Station\nAddress: 3808 North 22nd Street, Tampa, FL, 33610', 'NVDA Action - Javon Neal', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3281-autosave', '', '', '2012-07-27 22:50:11', '2012-07-28 02:50:11', '', 3281, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/07/26/3281-autosave/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The Seattle Solidarity Network, or SeaSol for short, started in 2008 with only a handful of activists, from a variety of backgrounds. The vision for SeaSol might best be described as a blending of the "direct action casework" of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and the "solidarity unionism" of the Industrial Workers of the World. Out of 25 fights SeaSol has taken on, they have won 22. Further still, SeaSol''s success rate can be attributed to its organizing model, with an emphasis on direct action, winnability, and mutual empowerment.\n\nMore information: <a href="http://seasol.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10&Itemid=26">here</a>\n\nThis organizing model can be readily applied to Tampa Bay activism. By mixing SeaSol''s volunteer organizing committee with spokescouncil coordination of affinity groups (in the vein of groups like the Direct Action Networks of the anti-globalization movement), we can form an umbrella organization that both coordinates direct action among diverse groups and accomplishes real victories. This mode of organizing will likely become useful with the onset of certain events, such as the RNC, and the coming loss of Voices of Freedom Park.\n\nIf you''re interested in helping form this model here as Tampa Solidarity Network, come to this foundational meeting to discuss the issue. We will focus on creating immediate organizing goals for the RNC and beyond.\n\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/351561871587879/permalink/351568594920540">Facebook event page</a>\n<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-solidarity-network-meeting/?instance_id=">Occupytampa.org event page</a>\n\n<h3>Occupy Tampa General Assembly</h3>\n\nFood Not Bombs will come and feed us!\n\n7:30 PM\nVoice of Freedom Park\n2101 W.

(3548, 2, '2012-08-07 09:37:05', '2012-08-07 13:37:05', 'Following recent events throughout the United States in which police officers have been observed using excessive force, we, as concerned civilians, feel the need to address the case of the shooting of Javon Neal. On Sunday, July 22nd, sixteen year old Javon Neal was shot down in his apartment complex by the District 3 police officers. Since then, some eyewitnesses have claimed that events unfolded differently than reported in the official narrative, and many are raising questions with regard to what happened. In the case of young Javon Neal we recognize that there is indubitably a need for transparency.\r\n\r\nResidents of lower-income communities fear the police more and more. People tell countless stories about their private interactions with officers. Stories involving the excessive use of force, a general lack of respect, and in many cases brutality. Many do not consider the shooting of Javon an isolated incident, rather, it exists within a continuum of similar incidents. Outside of poorer communities, civilians seldom witness or experience the same bullying. Low-income communities seem to create an opportunity for officers to feel a sense of authority and power over those without.\r\n\r\nThe lack of transparency thus far in regard to the Javon Neal case reflects the near sacrosanct nature of the institution of police department here and across the US. We must distinguish between "serving and protecting" and "patrolling and corralling." Police officers ought to de-escalate volatile situations throughout the community in order to cultivate safer spaces in which everyone can flourish, including the poor, the homeless, and other disenfranchised groups. In this case especially, the department should make every effort possible to remain transparent and responsive to the concerns of the community. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, people will remain increasingly suspicious of the official findings and statements. Part of the problem in this case stems from the nature of the relationship between "the Community" and "the Police."\r\n\r\nIn our current local and national discourse, any mention of the police in a critical matter tends to be an anathema, particularly for the white middle class. Part of the reason for this stems from the fundamental role that police play in society. For the wealthy elites, they are employees. For the aforementioned middle class, they are seen as trusted protectors. For everyone else they are an invading force. But for all, the police as an institution, act as separate from the deeper fabric of the communities that they police. We, the people of Occupy Tampa, would like to see this change. The practice of policing should not be separate from the basic internal functioning the community itself.\r\n\r\nA key step toward facilitating this would be a Community Review Board of police activity. A review board would be separate from the police department. It would have oversight and the power to enact disciplinary measures after assessing the conduct of the police. When incidents occurred that left cause for question in an officer''s behavior, those on the receiving end would not feel powerless, or that the burden of proof rested on them, the victims. Community review would help to facilitate accountability, through a healthy set of checks and balances on this particular function of government in our lives.\r\n\r\n<em>Passed by consensus by the Occupy Tampa General Assembly.</em>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>In other news:</h4>\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3503" title="mlkbanner" src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mlkbanner-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="332" />\r\n<hr />\r\n<img src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/327617_455878277776663_316060753_o-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="327617_455878277776663_316060753_o" width="591" height="332" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3509" />\r\n<hr />\r\n<img src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/562742_453028961394928_160574685_n4.jpg" alt="" title="562742_453028961394928_160574685_n" width="591" height="443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3513" />\r\n', 'A Statement from Occupy Tampa Addressing the Javon Neal Case and Police Transparency', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3500-revision-6', '', '', '2012-08-07 09:37:05', '2012-08-07 13:37:05', '', 3500, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/07/3500-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Since then, some eyewitnesses have claimed that events unfolded differently than reported in the official narrative, and many are raising questions with regard to what happened. In the case of young Javon Neal we recognize that there is indubitably a need for transparency.\r\n\r\nResidents of lower-income communities fear the police more and more. People tell countless stories about their private interactions with officers. Stories involving the excessive use of force, a general lack of respect, and in many cases brutality. Many do not consider the shooting of Javon an isolated incident, rather, it exists within a continuum of similar incidents. Outside of poorer communities, civilians seldom witness or experience the same bullying. Low-income communities seem to create an opportunity for officers to feel a sense of authority and power over those without.\r\n\r\nThe lack of transparency thus far in regard to the Javon Neal case reflects the near sacrosanct nature of the institution of police department here and across the US. We must distinguish between "serving and protecting" and "patrolling and corralling." Police officers ought to de-escalate volatile situations throughout the community in order to cultivate safer spaces in which everyone can flourish, including the poor, the homeless, and other disenfranchised groups. In this case especially, the department should make every effort possible to remain transparent and responsive to the concerns of the community. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, people will remain increasingly suspicious of the official findings and statements. Part of the problem in this case stems from the nature of the relationship between "the Community" and "the Police."\r\n\r\nIn our current local and national discourse, any mention of the police in a critical matter tends to be an anathema, particularly for the white middle class. Part of the reason for this stems from the fundamental role that police play in society. For the wealthy elites, they are employees. For the aforementioned middle class, they are seen as trusted protectors. For everyone else they are an invading force. But for all, the police as an institution, act as separate from the deeper fabric of the communities that they police. We, the people of Occupy Tampa, would like to see this change. The practice of policing should not be separate from the basic internal functioning the community itself.\r\n\r\nA key step toward facilitating this would be a Community Review Board of police activity. A review board would be separate from the police department. It would have oversight and the power to enact disciplinary measures after assessing the conduct of the police. When incidents occurred that left cause for question in an officer''s behavior, those on the receiving end would not feel powerless, or that the burden of proof rested on them, the victims.

Out of 25 fights SeaSol has taken on, they have won 22. Further still, SeaSol''s success rate can be attributed to its organizing model, with an emphasis on direct action, winnability, and mutual empowerment.\r\n\r\nMore information: <a href="http://seasol.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10&Itemid=26">here</a>\r\n\r\nThis organizing model can be readily applied to Tampa Bay activism. By mixing SeaSol''s volunteer organizing committee with spokescouncil coordination of affinity groups (in the vein of groups like the Direct Action Networks of the anti-globalization movement), we can form an umbrella organization that both coordinates direct action among diverse groups and accomplishes real victories. This mode of organizing will likely become useful with the onset of certain events, such as the RNC, and the coming loss of Voices of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nIf you''re interested in helping form this model here as Tampa Solidarity Network, come to this foundational meeting to discuss the issue.

The Seattle Solidarity Network, or SeaSol for short, started in 2008 with only a handful of activists, from a variety of backgrounds. The vision for SeaSol might best be described as a blending of the "direct action casework" of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and the "solidarity unionism" of the Industrial Workers of the World. Out of 25 fights SeaSol has taken on, they have won 22. Further still, SeaSol''s success rate can be attributed to its organizing model, with an emphasis on direct action, winnability, and mutual empowerment.\r\n\r\nMore information: <a href="http://seasol.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10&Itemid=26">here</a>\r\n\r\nThis organizing model can be readily applied to Tampa Bay activism. By mixing SeaSol''s volunteer organizing committee with spokescouncil coordination of affinity groups (in the vein of groups like the Direct Action Networks of the anti-globalization movement), we can form an umbrella organization that both coordinates direct action among diverse groups and accomplishes real victories. This mode of organizing will likely become useful with the onset of certain events, such as the RNC, and the coming loss of Voices of Freedom Park.\r\n\r\nIf you''re interested in helping form this model here as Tampa Solidarity Network, come to this foundational meeting to discuss the issue. We will focus on creating immediate organizing goals for the RNC and beyond.\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/351561871587879/permalink/351568594920540">Facebook event page</a>\r\n<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-solidarity-network-meeting/?instance_id=">Occupytampa.org event page</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Occupy Tampa General Assembly</h3>\r\n\r\nFood Not Bombs will come and feed us!\r\n\r\n7:30 PM\r\nVoice of Freedom Park\r\n2101 W.

In order to maximize available space to accommodate as many people as possible, we will (2) remove individual tents and replace them with large canopies to offer shade and protection from the weather. (3) Our liaison with Fire Dog Lake, Sonja Ebron, continues to work with Occupy Tampa by securing items such as sunscreen, bug spray, bandanas, portable water containers, sleeping bags and mats, UV protective shirts a\r\nnd other useful items.\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa has formed a Regional General Assembly to coordinate Occupy groups throughout the bay area, including: Occupy Lakeland, Occupy St. Petersburg, Occupy Bradenton, Occupy USF, Occupy New Port Richey, and Occupy Sarasota. We have tried to plan as much as possible ahead of time, but we want to leave space open to spontaneously produce additional actions by harnessing the number of people that arrive.\r\n\r\nFood not Bombs has called a World Gathering and plans to run feeding operations throughout the duration of the RNC. A week before the Republican National Convention, chapters of Food Not Bombs from every corner of the globe will convene in order to prepare to feed the thousands of protesters flooding into the city. FNB will serve brunch everyday at 10 am, at Voice of Freedom Park, and will also serve dinner before the General Assemblies. We will offer warm-ups at 9 am, including yoga & other light exercises.\r\n\r\nWe invite everyone to come and take advantage of the preparations we have made, to help ensure that all occupiers and other supporting groups can use this moment of national attention to confront the political status-quo.\r\n\r\nWe currently occupy a privately-owned, publicly accessible park (fittingly named "Voice of Freedom). The owner has donated the space for use by the Occupy Movement.Facilities include: running water, two port-a-potties, parking, Internet access, and electricity.\r\n\r\nOur address is 2101 W.

On Sunday, July 22nd, sixteen year old Javon Neal was shot down in his apartment complex by the District 3 police officers. Since then, some eyewitnesses have claimed that events unfolded differently than reported in the official narrative, and many are raising questions with regard to what happened. In the case of young Javon Neal we recognize that there is indubitably a need for transparency.\r\n\r\nResidents of lower-income communities fear the police more and more. People tell countless stories about their private interactions with officers. Stories involving the excessive use of force, a general lack of respect, and in many cases brutality. Many do not consider the shooting of Javon an isolated incident, rather, it exists within a continuum of similar incidents. Outside of poorer communities, civilians seldom witness or experience the same bullying. Low-income communities seem to create an opportunity for officers to feel a sense of authority and power over those without.\r\n\r\nThe lack of transparency thus far in regard to the Javon Neal case reflects the near sacrosanct nature of the institution of police department here and across the US. We must distinguish between "serving and protecting" and "patrolling and corralling." Police officers ought to de-escalate volatile situations throughout the community in order to cultivate safer spaces in which everyone can flourish, including the poor, the homeless, and other disenfranchised groups. In this case especially, the department should make every effort possible to remain transparent and responsive to the concerns of the community. Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, people will remain increasingly suspicious of the official findings and statements. Part of the problem in this case stems from the nature of the relationship between "the Community" and "the Police."\r\n\r\nIn our current local and national discourse, any mention of the police in a critical matter tends to be an anathema, particularly for the white middle class. Part of the reason for this stems from the fundamental role that police play in society. For the wealthy elites, they are employees. For the aforementioned middle class, they are seen as trusted protectors. For everyone else they are an invading force. But for all, the police as an institution, act as separate from the deeper fabric of the communities that they police. We, the people of Occupy Tampa, would like to see this change. The practice of policing should not be separate from the basic internal functioning the community itself.\r\n\r\nA key step toward facilitating this would be a Community Review Board of police activity. A review board would be separate from the police department. It would have oversight and the power to enact disciplinary measures after assessing the conduct of the police. When incidents occurred that left cause for question in an officer''s behavior, those on the receiving end would not feel powerless, or that the burden of proof rested on them, the victims. Community review would help to facilitate accountability, through a healthy set of checks and balances on this particular function of government in our lives.\r\n\r\n<em>Passed by consensus by the Occupy Tampa General Assembly.</em>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h4>In other news:</h4>\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3503" title="mlkbanner" src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mlkbanner-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="332" />\r\n<hr />\r\n<img src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/327617_455878277776663_316060753_o-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="327617_455878277776663_316060753_o" width="591" height="332" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3509" />\r\n<hr />\r\n<img src="http://occupytampa.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/562742_453028961394928_160574685_n4.jpg" alt="" title="562742_453028961394928_160574685_n" width="591" height="443" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3513" />\r\n', 'A Statement from Occupy Tampa Addressing the Javon Neal Case and Police Transparency', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3500-revision-7', '', '', '2012-08-08 13:50:56', '2012-08-08 17:50:56', '', 3500, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/08/3500-revision-7/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The Seattle Solidarity Network, or SeaSol for short, started in 2008 with only a handful of activists, from a variety of backgrounds. The vision for SeaSol might best be described as a blending of the "direct action casework" of the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and the "solidarity unionism" of the Industrial Workers of the World. Out of 25 fights SeaSol has taken on, they have won 22. Further still, SeaSol''s success rate can be attributed to its organizing model, with an emphasis on direct action, winnability, and mutual empowerment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore information: <a href="http://seasol.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10&Itemid=26">here</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis organizing model can be readily applied to Tampa Bay activism. By mixing SeaSol''s volunteer organizing committee with spokescouncil coordination of affinity groups (in the vein of groups like the Direct Action Networks of the anti-globalization movement), we can form an umbrella organization that both coordinates direct action among diverse groups and accomplishes real victories. This mode of organizing will likely become useful with the onset of certain events, such as the RNC, and the coming loss of Voices of Freedom Park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you''re interested in helping form this model here as Tampa Solidarity Network, come to this foundational meeting to discuss the issue. We will focus on creating immediate organizing goals for the RNC and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/351561871587879/permalink/351568594920540">Facebook event page</a><br>\r\n<a href="http://occupytampa.org/home/ai1ec_event/tampa-solidarity-network-meeting/?instance_id=">Occupytampa.org event page</a>', 'Tampa Solidarity Network - Organizing Commitee', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'tampa-solidarity-network-organizing-commitee', '', '', '2012-08-12 05:20:26', '2012-08-12 09:20:26', '', 0, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/?post_type=ai1ec_event&#038;p=3574&#038;instance_id=', 0, 'ai1ec_event', '', 1),

Thinking it over (Leslie) That number is too high. We need to  a) get the site blueprint or plan to get the dimensions of VOF and try to grid out the sleeping space, or b) Get a tape measure and do it ourselves.\r\n\r\nFood/water distribution: we discussed FNB presence will alleviate some of the duties for this. Leslie suggested we contact Occupy Supply and see if we can get a quantity of bottled/ 1 gal jugs of water and perhaps some energy bars (or trail mix) we can give people who need food and water right away.\r\n\r\nPortapotties: We have two and it''s barely accommodating our needs now with just us on site. We need at least two more. Someone suggested asking Mr. Redner to provide the extra portapotties. Otherwise we have to get them and pay for them ourselves (can someone contact the current service and ask how much for the 5 days service?)\r\n\r\nGarbage collection: Gonzo suggested we get a dumpster from the City of Tampa, he found out we need a permit for it which someone has to go to City Hall and apply for and we have to pay for the dumpster too. Gonzo agreed to find out how much it will cost and procedure for getting it. Gonzo also suggested we get some containers from recyclables, he wants all the recyclables to dispose of himself.\r\n\r\nSafer Spaces policy: We agreed we need several large signs detailing our SSP, and it should be included with orientation packets. No decision was made re: who is making and posting the signs.\r\nGonzo mentioned we must keep sidewalks clear at all times per our usage policy for the park.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed we will wear identifying shirts as security/peacekeepers/welcome/ OT VOF Staff. Leslie has lot of white shirts that can be sprayed over (they have business logos on them that must be covered she has all sizes, about 100 shirts.)\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion going back to how many we can fit into the park for overnight sleeping. We agreed to post Quiet Hours 12 midnight to 8 am, so ppl can rest.  We will direct ppl wanting to stay up/party to go off site.  We discussed keeping a tally when ppl arrive at welcome desk and when we reach the cap number, no one else will be accepted for sleeping space. Each tally will start over the next morning day. No one can reserve space for coming days. There is no space for us to store ppl''s belongings. Everyone is responsible for keeping their stuff with them, and taking it with them when they get up at 8 am,\r\n\r\n3 present discussed their belief that our guests are experienced protesters and know how to behave in close quarters.\r\n\r\nWe concluded with a schedule of people volunteering for security shifts. The shifts are 8am-4pm, 4pm-12am, and 12 am- 8 am. We agreed to the schedule and noted we will try to recruit OT members to help out as this is a skeleton crew at best of 1 person on 8-4, and 2 each on 4-12 and 12-8.\r\n\r\nContact Alton at 813-650-1775 or Leslie at 813-965-3861 for questions, or to sign up for security shifts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Security Meeting Minutes 8/8/2012', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '3575-revision', '', '', '2012-08-12 14:19:15', '2012-08-12 18:19:15', '', 3575, 'http://occupytampa.org/home/2012/08/12/3575-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In many jurisdictions, if a court determines that the charges against the defendant are based on entrapment, he or she cannot be convicted of the crime. Therefore, criminal defense lawyers might claim police or governmental entrapment as part of their strategy.

On the local front, corporate energy giants and Republican politicians have pushed to open Florida’s coast to off-shore drilling for oil and gas, permitted thousands of megawatts of new fossil fuel power plants in the state, and collaborated on plans to <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2011/20110419periana.html" target="_blank">fuse the biotech industry with energy giants</a>. On the national agenda, Republican politicians and lobbyists are promising industry heads support for tar sands exploration, gas fracking, coal mining and new nukes.\r\n\r\nMost groups planning to protest the Republican National Convention next week have focused on the wealth gap and the economy in general. But the history of failed civilizations show us that economic crises begin and end with ecological crisis.\r\n\r\nOur environmental message of protecting the planet from industrial pillage is needed here and now, more than ever.\r\n\r\nAll of us working on issues of pollution, water, development, energy, climate, greed, and the corruption that ties it all together, should be out in the streets of Tampa and St. Pete next week. (And out to protest the <a href="http://wallstsouth.org/" target="_blank">Democratic Convention the following week in North Carolina</a>, for most of the same reasons.)\r\n\r\nEEF! plans to have a presence throughout the RNC events. In particular, local organizers with <a href="http://resistrnc.org/" target="_blank">ResistRNC.org</a> in Tampa have called for August 30th to have a theme “promoting Environmental efforts.” We invite other environmental activists from across Florida and beyond to join us in taking action on this day to expose and confront the ecocidal elite.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be having an open meeting for those in South Florida wishing to discuss plans and make props for the RNC on August 22, 5pm at the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thenightheron" target="_blank">Night Heron Grassroots Activist Center. </a>\r\n\r\nWe may also re-convene in Tampa/St. Pete on the 29th to discuss plans for the 30th, Details TBA.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a series of flyers, posters and other EF! literature to circulate during the week. Please get in contact if you are interested to assist with producing or distributing these.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, EEF! plans to participate in the scheduled marches and rallies (see list below), and to stay flexible for opportunities to express our solidarity with other movements and our outrage at the industrial nightmare driven by the corporate politics represented by the RNC.\r\n\r\nGet in touch: <em>evergladesearthfirst [at] gmail.com</em>\r\n<h3><strong>Anti-RNC events we know abou:</strong></h3>\r\n<strong>All Week</strong>\r\n\r\nOccupy Tampa and World Food Not Bombs gathering site, for food and tent space.

Romney worked with Salvadorian oligarchs to initially fund the corporation. These same oligarchs financed right-wing death squads that killed over 35,000 El Salvadorians, and politically supported the military dictatorships there. This resulted in the death of over 75,000 people.\r\n\r\nBain Capital recently bought the Sensata plant in Freeport, Illinois. The company was profitable and competitive, but Bain Capital decided to move the plant to China and lay-off all the American workers. To add insult to injury, Bain Capital then brought over Chinese workers and made the soon-to-be-laid-off American workers train their replacements. The American workers had to watch people dismantle their factory and ship it, piece by piece, to China.\r\n\r\nBain Capital bought HCA (Hospital Corporation of America) after HCA settled with various government agencies for over $2 billion dollars due to a massive medicare fraud settlements. HCA seems to have not changed its ways. Recently, whistleblowers have revealed that, under pressure for profits and high returns on investment, HCA doctors misdiagnosed heart conditions and performed unnecessary heart surgeries in order to drive up business at several of its hospitals. After the whistleblowers exposed these dangerous and unnecessary surgeries, HCA fired them.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year a Bain Capital subsidiary, OSI (Carabba''s, Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill, Flemmings, and Roy''s), tried to push a bill through the Florida Legislature that would cut server''s pay in half from $4.65 an hour to $2.13 an hour. Bloomin'' Brands (formerly OSI) made millions this year after a successful IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, all the while advocating to reduce worker''s pay.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the DeepHorizon oil rig spilled oil over the entire Gulf Coast. Fish, birds, and other dead animals started washing up on shore. BP had hired Bain Capital to give financial advice on how to cut costs and raise profits. Bain advised BP to make major cuts in safety-related expenses. Regulators cited these very cost-cutting measures as the main cause of the disaster.\r\n\r\nMitt Romney co-founded, served as CEO, and continues to own a major stake in Bain Capital.

No one individual can speak for the movement; they can only speak for themselves. Official statements can only be released by the General Assembly after everyone has agreed through consensus that the statements represent the entire group. General Assemblies rarely consent to an official spokesperson or representative.\r\n\r\nAny group or individual claiming to present a representative of the Occupy Movement has not been honest. If a General Assembly approves an official representative, that person represents only that particular Assembly. Each Occupy group exists as its own autonomous entity at the local level and is not controlled or directed by any other group or entity. For one individual to represent the entire movement, this individual would need to be approved by all the General Assemblies of each and every occupation.\r\n\r\nWe do not support this partisan farce. This is a tea party hosted event, moderated by a member of the tea party and would include a tea party member in the debate. Debates should be hosted and moderated by objective third parties who will not favor either side.\r\n\r\nMoreover, framing the debate in this way perpetuates the misconception of Occupy as a leftist version of the Tea Party. Quite the contrary, we consist of a diverse array of people, ideas, and grievances. Some occupiers do not identify themselves through political affiliations. Others identify themselves as conservatives, progressives, independents, anarchists, republicans, democrats, libertarians, socialists, feminists, and yes, even some who identify with the Tea Party. We are, after all, the 99%.\r\n\r\nThe conditions effecting the 99% transcend political categorization. Our differences do not preclude us from cooperating to address the issues we agree on.

On the local front, corporate energy giants and Republican politicians have pushed to open Florida’s coast to off-shore drilling for oil and gas, permitted thousands of megawatts of new fossil fuel power plants in the state, and collaborated on plans to <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2011/20110419periana.html" target="_blank">fuse the biotech industry with energy giants</a>.

Many of the officers walked on and began searching private property throughout the West Tampa area without permission of the property owners, without warrants, and without probable cause.\n\nAt this time, the police were continually pulling vehicles over without any justification all around the West Tampa camp.

Nearly every vehicle that entered or exited the West Tampa area was subjected to arbitrary searches. The police shined their flashlights into on coming traffic to illegally search vehicles. This activity was extremely dangerous as the light blinded drivers and could have caused accidents as well as fatal police and civilian injuries.\n\nWhen the police officers walked through the park a second, and even a third time without permission and conducted numerous searches, this constituted a clear violation of the Constitution''s Fourth Amendment which protects against such actions. In addition, the 2 police officers did not have probable cause or display a warrant of any type to enter Voice of Freedom Park.\n\nIf this type of illegal behavior from the police continues, the police department and the city of Tampa can expect internal affairs complaints, criminal charges, and numerous civil lawsuits.\n\nAmong the people that were clearly upset at this blatant misuse of city resources were West Tampa business owners and workers that lost multitudes of patrons due to these intimidation tactics. Occupy Tampa stands in solidarity with the residents and businesses of West Tampa against this police intimidation and harassment.\n\nThe news media is invited to speak with members of Occupy Tampa who witnessed these events to an event on Monday at 5pm.
